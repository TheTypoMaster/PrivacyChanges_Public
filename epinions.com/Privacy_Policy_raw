				<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>This Privacy
Policy (“Policy”) describes your privacy rights regarding our collection, use,
storage, sharing, and protection of your personal information.  It governs your
participation on the eBayCommerce.com, Shopping.com, Epinions.com,
DealTime.com, and PriceTool.com websites (including the versions of these sites
in foreign jurisdictions), their sister sites, and all co-branded versions of
these sites or any successor brand that eBay may designate from time to time in
its discretion (in the United States or foreign jurisdictions), which are
referred to collectively as the “eBay Commerce Network” or “ECN,” along with
their related sites, applications, services, and tools, regardless of how you
access or use them, including through mobile devices.</p>

this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site.  Any
such amendment shall take effect when such amendment is sent by email or posted

aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other
information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.</p>

                <a name="info1"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Information You Share on Site</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Some portions of the eBay Commerce Network allow you to contribute ratings, reviews, tags, comments, and other content, either on one of our websites or via our product review services on other websites. This content may be displayed publicly on the eBay Commerce Network and elsewhere on the web. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member or user name. Registered members can publish reviews by logging in to their accounts; reviews submitted through our product review services cannot be deleted once uploaded. For some of our features, other members may be able to request email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews. You can also choose to make your wish lists private, but they are public by default. </p>
                <p>We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, market products or identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we do not expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.</p>	
				<p>Your ECN User ID is displayed throughout the eBay Commerce Network (and so it is available to the public), and is connected to all of your ECN activity. This means that other people can see the feedback, ratings, and comments associated with your User ID. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites likewise refer to specific User IDs. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your ECN activities. </p>
<p>If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, you must log out of your account after use, or else certain information about you such as your User ID, activity, or reminders from eBay may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p>
