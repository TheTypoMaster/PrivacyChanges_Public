Terms and Booking Conditions of www.CRUISE.co.uk"NAMES" The passenger names given at the time of booking have been confirmed by you and will be repeated back. The spelling of the first name, middle name and surname must match your passport exactly. Middle name/s are required on all new bookings. Any changes will result in a charge to you from the cruise or tour operator ( see cruise line T&C's http://www.cruise.co.uk/holidays/cruise-line-terms-and-conditions/ ) Please contact us as soon as possible.  "WHEN TO PAY YOUR BALANCE"Balance payments are due 17 weeks before departure for most cruise lines. However, please check your specific balance due date which will be displayed on your booking confirmation. " YOUR FINANCIAL PROTECTION"  ABTA licence - we are a member of ABTA (Association of British Travel Agents) no.78024. This means your money is safe. If you are already on a trip, you will be able to continue as originally planned. ABTA will make sure you are never stranded abroad. In the event of financial collapse of any cruise line, airline, tour operator or any other provider, if you've not yet started your trip, you'll get your money back or where possible ABTA will make arrangements for you to continue with the planned trip.  ATOL licence- we are member of ATOL  (Air Travel Organiser's License) no. 3385. When you buy an ATOL protected flight or flight inclusive holiday from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong." “We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).”  “If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.” "CONTRACT / LIABILITY" All bookings accepted by www.CRUISE.co.uk and arrangements made are subject to the booking conditions imposed by the principals. The principals are the cruise operators, airlines and any other supplier. Your contract is with the prinicpials defined above. All tickets, vouchers and coupons are issued by www.CRUISE.co.uk in their capacity as Retail Agents for ATOL Holders, upon the express condition that www.CRUISE.co.uk is not liable to any passenger for loss, damage, delay, injury, cancellation, or any additional expense, suffered by any passenger whatsoever, or any cause beyond www.CRUISE.co.uk control shall be occasioned by www.CRUISE.co.uk or any of its officials, agents or representatives. The total liability of www.CRUISE.co.uk shall not exceed the total payment received from the client in respect of any booking. "TICKETS"Most cruise line & airline tickets are now in the form of E-Tickets, which means these must be printed  ONLINE. For most cruise lines your tickets will be available for printing about 4 weeks before departure. Simply visit www.CRUISE.co.uk and go to the blue button "Make a Payment" then select your cruise line.If you do not have a printer, please contact your Specialist Cruise Consultant. If your cruise line is not listed online, your tickets will be posted to you approximately 2 weeks before your departure date.  "LUGGAGE LABELS"For most cruise lines, these now come in the form of durable paper. You should receive these directly from the cruise line, but they are also available to be printed online about 4 weeks before departure-again by visiting www.CRUISE.co.uk and go to the blue button "Make a Payment" then select your cruise line.  "SHORE EXCURSIONS"To save you money www.CRUISE.co.uk now work with a leading independent shore excursion company called Cruising Attractions. They are fully insured and work with many of the same tour companies that the cruise lines use. Please click here for all shore excursion tour details and to make bookings. "WHAT'S INCLUDED/NOT INCLUDED" If you have booked a cabin on a "GUARANTEE" (GTEE or GTY) basis, this means you will be allocated any cabin in the grade booked (where specified) or higher. You will normally receive a specific cabin number when the cruise tickets are issued or at the latest, when you board the ship. If your booking includes any "ONBOARD CREDIT per cabin or per person, FREE CAR PARKING, FREE COACH OR RAIL TRANSFERS" these will be specified on the www.CRUISE.co.uk confirmation invoice.  Transfers are included (and provided by the cruise) only if you have booked a standard fly/cruise where we have booked both the flight/s & cruise through the cruise line. If your booking is on a "Cruise Only basis", TRANSFERS are not included unless they are specified on the www.CRUISE.co.uk confirmation invoice.  GRATUITIES - If you have pre-paid gratuities, then these will be specified on the www.CRUISE.co.uk confirmation invoice. "FLIGHTS"Unless any flights details are included on your booking confirmation invoice, your booking is on a "Cruise Only basis". If flights are included, please be aware that the flight times and routing (unless already specified on the confirmation invoice) are on request with the cruise operator. All flights are in Economy class (unless otherwise specified). Flight routings may be indirect or on a charter basis. The Cruise Operator/Supplier/Airline reserves the right to make any amendments to the flight times and routings at any point. Please refer to the terms and conditions of the relevant cruise line brochure ( http://www.cruise.co.uk/holidays/cruise-line-terms-and-conditions/ )Once flight times have been assigned by the cruise line, these can viewed via our website www.CRUISE.co.uk by clicking on "Make a Payment", then Check-in Online & select the relevant cruise line. "BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE"Please see below for typical Scheduled & Charter (not low-cost carriers) flight checked-in baggage allowances which act as a rough guide only.  Baggage allowances are imposed by the airline, so please refer to each individual airline for up-to-date information. However, even if baggage allowances do change, the applicable baggage allowance is determined by when the cruise operator or supplier issue the tickets, which is typically about 2 weeks before departure.Economy = 1 piece of luggage per person max 20kgs (except British Airways & some Charter flights max 23kgs)Premium Economy = 2 pieces of luggage per person or 1 piece of luggage with a higher max allowanceBusiness & First Class = 2 or 3 piece of luggage per person with varying higher max allowances "TRAVEL INSURANCE"Cruise lines require passengers to have comprehensive travel insurance. www.CRUISE.co.uk can arrange your travel insurance cover. Please ask your Specialist Cruise Consultant for details. If you have purchased travel insurance through www.CRUISE.co.uk and our Insurance provider Holiday Extras (or previously with CoverMore), please read all the terms & conditions of the policy document. There is a 14 day "cooling off" period from the date of purchase, if you decide not to be coveredthrough www.CRUISE.co.uk. If you have not purchased travel insurance through www.CRUISE.co.uk, alternative insurance arrangements should be made for all passengers travelling and you must notify us with the policy details. Please click here for a Travel Insurance Quote "PASSPORTS & VISAS"It is the responsibility of all passengers to have a full valid passport which is valid for 6 months after their return date. For further information contact the Passport Office on Tel: 0300 222 0000 or visit http://www.passport.gov.uk/  We would strongly recommend visiting the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad for all the latest travel, health and VISA information if you are travelling to a destination outside the EU or the World Travel Guide http://www.worldtravelguide.net. It is especially important to check in plenty of time before your holiday as entry visas or permits may be necessary for certain destinations and it is the responsibility of the individual traveller to obtain. For preferential rates on VISAS, please contact CIBT Visa Service by clicking here or call 0844 800 4650 (Option 2) mentioning www.CRUISE.co.uk..  If you are travelling to the USA, the days of filling out a green I-94 piece of paper (commonly known as the Visa Waiver form) on a plane for entry into the US have ended. You now need to fill in an online request to enter the States, at least three days before travelling (although you'll usually get a decision in minutes, it can take up to three days), otherwise you will be turned away at US immigration. The form is called the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation form or ESTA for short. The website address is https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta. It costs US$14 (about £10 depending on the exchange rate at the time) plus the ESTA lasts two years (or until your passport expires). Once the ESTA is out of date you need to reapply. The only method for this new procedure is online, so if you do not have internet access, you may need to get help froma friend, family member or colleague who can register online on your behalf.  If you are travelling to INDIA or CHINA, all passengers require a visa, regardless of whether you are visiting on a cruise ship and do not intend to leave the ship or travelling by land. To obtain the visa or for more information, please click here or call CIBT Visa Service mentioning www.CRUISE.co.uk for preferential rates on call 0844 800 4650 (Option 2).  "HEALTH & "VACCINATIONS"It is especially important to check in plenty of time before your holiday, so please contact your G.P, practice nurse or travel health clinic for relevant health & vaccination requirements for your chosen destinations or check online at http://www.dh.gov.uk/travellers.  The EHIC has replaced the old E111. From 1 January 2006, E111s are no longer valid. The quickest and easiest way to get an EHIC is to apply online at www.ehic.org.uk/InternetPROD/home.do. The EHIC is normally valid for three to five years and covers any medical treatment that becomes necessary during your trip, because of either illness or an accident. The card gives access to state-provided medical treatment only, and you'll be treated on the same basis as an 'insured' person living in the country you're visiting. Remember, this might not cover all the things you'd expect to get free of charge from the NHS in the UK. You may have to make a contribution to the cost of your care, so travel insurance is highly recommended.    "DINING ARRANGEMENTS" Your meal sitting & table size (where specified) will have been requested at the time of booking. Please be aware that these are on "a request basis" and not guaranteed. However, the cruise line will do all they can to accommodate every request. "SPECIAL REQUESTS"Any special requests (where specified) will be passed on to the cruise line at time of booking. Please be aware that these are on "a request basis" and not guaranteed. However, the cruise line/operator/airline will do all they can to accommodate every request."AMENDMENTS"The Cruise Operator/Supplier reserves the right to make any changes to your booking. Please refer to the terms & conditions of the relevant cruise line brochure, a copy of which is available on request or online by visiting our website http://www.cruise.co.uk/holidays/cruise-line-terms-and-conditions. (for most Cruise Operators).www.CRUISE.co.uk reserves the right to make an amendment charge of £25 per person per change in addition to any Cruise Operator/Supplier charges for any voluntary amendments (if the amendment to any component of your trip is even possible - again, please refer to the terms & conditions of the cruise line brochure, a copy of which is available on request or online by visiting our website http://www.cruise.co.uk/holidays/cruise-line-terms-and-conditions/. for most Cruise Operators). "CANCEL & REBOOKING TO A DIFFERENT CRUISE"If you wish to transfer to a new cruise AND it is possible, subject to the terms and conditions of the Cruise Operator/Supplier, the Cruise Operator/Supplier will charge an admin fee. In addition to this fee, www.CRUISE.co.uk will charge an admin fee of £25 per person (or minimum £50 per cabin). The terms & conditions of Cruise Operators are available on request or to view them online, please visit our website http://www.cruise.co.uk/holidays/cruise-line-terms-and-conditions. (for most Cruise Operators)   "CANCELLATIONS & REFUNDS"Your cruise line deposit & www.CRUISE.co.uk booking fee/deposit are non-refundable. Your booking fees (not credit charge charges) will be waived and any monies paid will reduce your cruise line balance as long as you do not cancel your booking. Cancellations incur a www.CRUISE.co.uk fee of £50 per person. Booking fees are normally shown on your invoice along with the cruise line deposit under the heading "Deposit Paid". Cancellations can only be processed with written or email authorisation from the passengers travelling. If your booking is cancelled www.CRUISE.co.uk / Victoria Travel will withdraw any discount given. These charges are made in addition to any charge made by your Cruise Operator/Supplier which is detailed in their terms & conditions, a copy of which is available on request.

Any applicable refunds may take up to 6 weeks to be processed. "TAILOR MADE BOOKINGS" Our Tailor Made holidays have separate terms & conditions please hit the link below to view full details:http://www.cruise.co.uk/cruise-guides/tailor-made-terms-and-conditions/  "ON BOARD BOOKINGS" Many people book another cruise whilst onboard as you often receive special deals with extra benefits. If you have a future cruise credit or voucher that you want to redeem on another cruise please mention it to the sales consultant at the start of the call and we will be happy to get it applied to your new booking ( If the cruise line/supplier have ok'd it once they have received it from you ). Please contact us as soon as you return by calling the Specialist Cruise Consultant directly who booked your last cruise, by calling our main sales line on Tel: 0800 408 6200 or send an email to  Sales@cruise.co.uk  "YOUR NEXT CRUISE HOLIDAY"If you have not made an "Onboard booking" with the cruise line,  we would be delighted to arrange your next cruise holiday.
