a large number of vendors located in both the USA and abroad. Our dedication to finding you the
very best in housewares, clothing, furniture, toys, holiday accents and more includes thorough

            Transparency in Supply Chains
                    
 Disclosure Statement
Pursuant to California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The
Lakeside Collection and those in our supply chain do not employ slaves or trafficked persons,
and we take steps to ensure that this expectation is met by The Lakeside Collection and our
direct contractors. Lakeside includes in its contracts with suppliers a requirement that the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is followed. This act specifically states that goods
manufactured in whole or in part of prison labor, and/or forced labor, and/or indentured labor
is prohibited. Our suppliers are subject to regular audits and are contractually obligated to
agree to these terms. Failure to do so is considered a breach of contract. Additionally, we
maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees to ensure
compliance.
