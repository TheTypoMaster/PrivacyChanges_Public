When Information We Collect Through Our Sites May Be Disclosed to Third Parties
We disclose to third parties the personal (or other) information collected about you through any of our Sites either (i) when we have your permission to do so or (ii) in any of the following situations (without your permission):

We may share the information collected about you within the Petco family of companies, which means we may disclose the information collected about you to our affiliates (subject to the terms of this privacy policy).
We may disclose the information collected about you to our third-party contractors and partners in connection with their performing services or other activities in support of the Sites and/or our businesses, or their completing or confirming on our behalf a transaction or series of transactions that you conduct with us.
As noted above, information about you collected by third-party ads, content or technologies integrated with any of our Sites may be disclosed to such third parties.
We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you and other users of our Sites without restriction. In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.
We may disclose to one or more third parties the information collected about you as part of a merger, acquisition or other sale or transfer of any of the assets or business of Petco and/or of any of our affiliates. Please note that the entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions may not comply with all of the terms of this privacy policy.
We may disclose information about you to the government or to other third parties to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, subpoenas or other legal process, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity associated with any of the Sites or our business. We reserve the right to release information collected through any of the Sites to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.
We may also disclose information about you to third parties if needed to enforce any of the terms of use for one of our Sites or other agreements, or any investigation of potential violations thereof; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; to protect against harm to any of the Sites; or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection).

Security Measures for Information Collected Through Our Sites
To help protect the privacy of information collected through our Sites, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices. In addition, we take commercially reasonable steps to store such information with the objective of protecting such data against unauthorized access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, please be aware that our Sites are operated on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control and that may compromise the security of information collected about you. 
Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. You understand that it may be possible for third parties not under Petco's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through one of our Sites or via email. Accordingly, although we undertake commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through our Sites, due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization. Any such transmission of information about you to Petco is at your own risk.
How to Correct or Update Information About You Collected Through Our Sites
You may correct or update information collected about you through any of our Sites by contacting us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy below, or (if available on a particular Site) by editing your information and preferences on the "My Account" page. You may also unsubscribe to any email subscriptions by following the applicable "unsubscribe" link. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to update our files to reflect your request as promptly as possible. 
We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements. In addition, please note that we cannot update any information about you collected through any of the Sites that has already been disclosed (as permitted under this privacy policy) to a third party.
How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
At this time, our Sites do not support "Do Not Track" preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, our Sites are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set. For more information about Do Not Track, visit donottrack.us. 
Transfer of Data from Outside the United States
If you use any of our Sites from outside of the United States, information that we collect about you through the Site will be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely. By using the Site, you consent to the transfer of data about you into the United States, as well as the processing of such data in the United States. 
Children
Our Sites are not designed to appeal to persons under 13 years old ("children"). We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children through our Sites, except for persistent identifiers that may be collected through children's sections of our Sites which (as permitted by applicable law) we will use solely to support the internal operations of the Sites. If we learn that any unauthorized personal information of a child has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided any such personal information to us, then you may contact us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy below and request that we delete that information from our systems.
Privacy Policies of any Linked Websites or Other Parties
This privacy policy only addresses Petco's practices for the personal (and other) information that we may obtain about you through any of the Sites. Please be aware that when you use or access any of the Sites, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control, and Petco is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked websites. We would expect most, if not all, of these third parties will collect information about you when you use their offerings. However, Petco is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless whether they are linked or otherwise connected to our Sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy and terms of use whenever interacting with any third-party website, app, or other offering.

All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to us at CaliforniaPrivacyRights@petco.com.
Governing Law

You also agree to abide by any limitation on damages contained in the terms of use applicable to the Site or any other agreement that we have with you.
