Source and Screen










 Put the Work of Finding the Right Candidates into Our Hands 
 On average, candidates use 16 different sources when looking for a job: Let our team advertise your jobs for you in all the right places.  

 



Finding the right talent for your open positions doesn't have to be difficult. With Source and Screen, we create a pipeline of qualified and interested candidates for you -- simplifying your process so you can focus on other business initiatives. 
How Does it Work?

First, we determine where your ideal candidates are located, which resources they use to find a job, and what they are looking for in an employer.
Based on those results, we get to work finding the best candidates for your open position (so you don't have to). Our team of strategists sources and screens candidates for your open positions, delivering only the top talent and automatically filling up your interview schedule with only the best people for your open jobs.

Benefits:

Speed up your search for the perfect candidates with an experienced team of project managers and the right job seeker data to drive your recruitment strategy.
Build a pipeline of candidates and give your open position and company maximum exposure to the right candidate pool.
Maximize your recruitment investment by paying only one flat rate per position -- no matter how many hires you make. You also gain full ownership of the candidates we send you for review.

Customized to Meet Your Needs:
Many companies experience a continuous need to recruit target talent, but do not have the resources to effectively locate, engage and hire that talent. Our platform sourcing solutions are customized to meet your needs and can assist your team's sourcing and screening efforts across all open positions. Platform sourcing engagements can also include consultative services, training for your recruiters and hiring managers, managing all or select steps in the recruitment process on your behalf, providing comprehensive reporting and tracking and more.
