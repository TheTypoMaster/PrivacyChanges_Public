				Global Privacy Statement - United States and Canada
			






This privacy statement (“Statement”) applies to all of the hotel brands owned or licensed by Marriott International, Inc. and its affiliates, including The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. (collectively, the “Marriott Group”).
We have prepared this Statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern our use of information we obtain from our customers, including information we obtain through our websites, including Marriott.com, Ritz-Carlton.com and other websites owned or controlled by the Marriott Group (collectively, the “Websites”). As used in this Statement, the term “Authorized Licensees” means certain companies that have entered into a license or similar agreement with a Marriott Group company to sell products and services under a Marriott Group brand. Authorized Licensees are independent from the Marriott Group, and include entities such as Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation operator of the Marriott Vacation Club and Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Real Estate, and the issuer of the Marriott Rewards Credit Card.
Our Websites are available to visitors located throughout the world, and operated for different purposes. For instance, some may be specific to a hotel brand or property, and others may enable you to shop for travel-related products. Our Websites are generally operated from the United States in accordance with laws of the United States and visitors to our Websites should be aware that the laws of the United States may differ from those of your country of residence. Marriott International, Inc. and its Affiliates are certified to the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for the transfer of personal data to the United States, and such transfers are subject to our European Union and Switzerland Privacy Statement. Where we operate country-specific Websites, those Websites are operated in accordance with the laws of that specific country.
This Statement was last updated on May 21, 2015, to describe how the privacy statement applies to all of the information we obtain from you and to update the privacy statement with respect to Marriott’s Authorized Licensees, franchisees and certain other commercial partners set out below.

Social Media




An App may permit you to log in from, or connect with, social media services to which you belong so that it is easy for you to share your experiences and to see the experiences of others. If you sign up for Marriott Rewards on www.marriott.com using your social media account, link your Marriott Rewards account to your social media account, or use certain other www.marriott.com social media features, we may access information about you via that social media provider in accordance with the provider's policies.
The information collected from or about you by social media networks with which you connect the App is governed by the policies of those social media networks. Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations ("Location Data") to provide you with relevant content.






Click to Chat




We use third party software to proactively initiate or offer online chat if we believe you would benefit from assistance. All information you enter via online chat may be associated to your email address and will be stored in our systems with any other information you provide and any transaction details.






Web-enabled Mobile Device





You can access Marriott.com from a web-enabled mobile device to find a hotel (including clicking to call the hotel), make, view or cancel a reservation or to enroll in Marriott and/or Ritz-Carlton Rewards.
If you have downloaded the application to your device such as a BlackBerry, iPad or iPhone you can take advantage of finding a hotel near you that is provided via Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. No personal information is retained to deliver this service. In addition, these applications will allow you to select one touch authentication if you would like to have your Marriott Rewards number and password remembered so that you do not need to enter them every time when you are using these devices to access Marriott.com.







Ritz-Carlton – Gold Standard Service




As part our commitment to Gold Standard service at our Ritz-Carlton branded properties our staff members occasionally record details of guest preferences and other personal information about our guests in order to provide a more personalized experience on future visits. This might include your meal or pillow preferences, anniversary dates or other things that make your stay more comfortable. This information is made available to our other properties around the world. If you wish to opt out of this program or have any preferences you would like us to make note of, please let us know at any time.






Disclosure of Personal Information




We may disclose personal information in the following ways:

Reservations

The personal information you provide to us for making a reservation is made available to the applicable hotel for the purpose of meeting your reservation request.
After your stay we retain your personal information including details of your stay, room/accommodation type and amenities used.
Reservations booked at properties that are operated by a franchisee or Authorized Licensee will have the details of the booking disclosed to the third party franchisee or Authorized Licensee for the sole purpose of providing the requested goods and services. In some countries we may also disclose details of your booking to the Authorized Licensee which owns the property managed by us for the sole purpose of meeting your reservation request.


Travel Related Services

To provide you with a single source for purchasing packages that include other travel-related services such as airline tickets or rental cars, including those offered by Authorized Licensees, we have entered into agreements with select reputable third-party companies that sell Marriott- or Ritz-Carlton-branded products which require them to secure your personal information and , to use it only to execute the transactions you request or to market Marriott- or Ritz-Carlton-branded vacation products. Any personal information you provide to these third parties will be controlled by each of them and is subject to their respective privacy statements and practices.


eFolio

If you are an employee or contractor of a company that participates in Marriott's eFolio Program and you use the corporate credit card that is provided to you by your employer to pay for your hotel expenses (hotel folio) at a Marriott participating property, an extract of your hotel folio detailing the goods and services provided to you during your hotel stay (as an individual traveler, or as part of a group, meeting or event) will be transferred electronically to the credit card company or its agents, who will in turn, forward that extract to your employer to facilitate the processing and tracking of the travel related expenses of their employees. Once Marriott transfers this information, our Privacy Statement will no longer apply and the handling of your personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of your employer, the relevant credit card network operator, the relevant card issuer and/or their respective subcontractors.
Your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number, as entered on your reservation, acts as an eFolio identifier, allowing the transmission of your bill to your email address. If your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number is applied to another person's room reservation, or if you make a reservation for another person and provide your email address for that reservation, that person's bill will be transmitted to your email address as well. It is your responsibility to inform that person that their bill will be emailed to you when your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number or email address is attached to his/her reservation unless he/she makes alternative arrangements with a front desk associate during the stay.


Marriott Rewards Information

We will only disclose member and customer information within the Marriott Group, to person(s) authorized by you, to Marriott’s Authorized Licensees or to other third parties as set out in this statement.


Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Real Estate

Ritz-Carlton is pleased to present luxury residences in various locations. In addition, we also offer fractional ownership interests in a variety of resorts. As set out in this Privacy Statement, Marriott and its Authorized Licensees may use customer’s personal information for the purpose of marketing Marriott and Ritz-Carlton’s luxury residences and fractional ownership interests. If you decide to purchase either a residence or fractional ownership interest, you will be provided a specific disclosure around the personal information required to complete the transaction and the uses and protection of that information.


Authorized Licensees

Personal information may be disclosed to Authorized Licensees, including Marriott Vacations Worldwide operator of Marriott Vacation Club, for the limited purpose of marketing and operating the business that they license from Marriott or Ritz-Carlton or marketing their Marriott- or Ritz-Carlton-branded products and services or for the purpose of providing you with offers and promotions.
If you connect to a separate website operated by an Authorized Licensee, including the Marriott Vacation Club, the handling of your personal information will be subject to their respective privacy policies.


Third Party Service Providers/Processors:

Marriott and Ritz-Carlton each use the services of third party processors, such as market researchers, fulfillment houses, email service providers and mail houses that process mail and communications for the Marriott Group, and including in some cases, for Authorized Licensees. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personal information for any purpose other than for the purpose Marriott specifies.



We may disclose your personal information in relation to the reorganization, sale or disposal of all or a part of our business or assets, joint ventures and related business transactions, including in relation to audit or reporting and other regulatory requirements. Any successor or assign may use your personal information for the same reasons as set out in this Statement.
