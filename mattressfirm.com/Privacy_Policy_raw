Rest Easy: How we use It? 



We take seriously the trust you place in us, therefore, you have our commitment that we will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others. We may, at times, produce internal reports about our user demographic, age and online usage information. This allows us to work more closely with advertisers to provide content and offers that are more relevant to our users. We will never include any personal information of our users in these reports. We may also use the information collected for the following purposes: 1) to fulfill your requests for products and services; 2) to provide you with targeted offers and advertising on the Site; 3) to contact you with information and promotional materials and offers from Mattress Firm, as well as from our subsidiaries, affiliates, marketing partners, advertisers and other third parties; 4) to contact you when necessary; 5) to review Site usage and operations; and 6) to conduct research and/or analysis. 



In addition, we reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent to the following entities for the following purposes: 1) to our employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultant, business associates, service providers and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable any of these entities to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; 2) to our employees, independent contractors, service providers and suppliers, to fulfill a product or service request; 3) as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of the Site Terms of Use or of our rights or the rights of any third party; 4) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; 5) to conduct investigations of consumer complaints; and 6) as provided for under the “Unforeseen Circumstances” section below.


Rest Easy: How secure is your site? 



Mattress Firm, Inc. has taken your security seriously. We have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and managerial steps to safeguard and secure the information we collect from Site visitors. We have limited access to private and confidential data to those employees with a specific need to retrieve this information. To maintain this highest level of security, we do not store private information on our website. We do not direct the Site to, nor do we knowingly collect, any personal information from children under the age of thirteen.

The Site may contain links to third-party websites, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the activities and practices that take place on these sites. Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any site that you may access through our Site.

As we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Mattress Firm, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets. 


Third Party Advertising Partners
We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet.
These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interactions with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information.

In addition to the information about your visits to our website, our service providers may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Mattress Firm.
Currently, we use third party-placed tracking pixels and cookies from the following advertising delivery partners: TruEffect, Amazon and Google.
