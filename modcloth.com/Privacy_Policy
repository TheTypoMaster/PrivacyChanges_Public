How We Protect Your Information
ModCloth.com utilizes some of the most advanced technology available today for Internet security purposes. When you access our checkout and enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, your information is protected with both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to ModCloth.
Our site is verified by Fastly and uses Braintree for all of our secure credit card transactions. We are a BBB accredited business.
In addition, ModCloth.com is hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or outside access to keep us all safe!
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at support@modcloth.com.

You can access, update, or change your personal information and communication preferences by signing into your ModCloth membership page and modifying your preferences at your discretion.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
You can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or request, but then you may not be able to create a membership with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features.

Your California Privacy Rights
Under California's "Shine the Light" law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2012 will receive information regarding 2011 sharing activities).
To obtain this information from ModCloth please send an email message to support@modcloth.com with "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your email address in response. Not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements, and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.

Privacy Policy Updates
ModCloth may, at any time and without notice, modify and update this Privacy Policy by revising it on the Site. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of any such revisions. You should therefore periodically visit this page to review the current Privacy Policy.
