                <h3>GROOVEBOOK</h3>
                
                <p>Our mobile app Groovebook subscription service (the "Groovebook Service") offers you an opportunity to have your smartphone photos shipped to you in a 4" x 6" photo book every month. By purchasing or receiving the Groovebook Service you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Groovebook Service. </p> 
                
                <p>The Groovebook Service, which may start with a free trial, will continue month-to month unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. Your device must be able to support the Groovebook Service and you must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the Groovebook Service. We will bill the monthly subscription fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month by contacting customer service at <a href="mailto:info@groovebook.com">info@groovebook.com</a> in order to avoid billing of the next month's subscription fees to your Payment Method. The monthly subscription price includes shipping and handling, but does not include any applicable taxes. We may change the price for the subscription from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the Groovebook Service after the price change takes effect, you accept the new price. If you reside in a country that is part of the European Union and have purchased a subscription, you have the right to change your mind and receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of purchase (the "Cooling-off Period"), but only if you have not logged in or otherwise redeemed or started to consume it. Your Groovebook Service subscription and payment to us will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription by contacting customer service at <a href="mailto:info@groovebook.com">info@groovebook.com</a> or we terminate it before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period. However, if you cancel your payment and/or terminate the Terms after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), and/or before the end of the subscription period, we will not refund any fees already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.</p>
                
                <p>In certain jurisdictions, gift subscriptions for the Groovebook Service may be available for purchase, which are one time use cards and are only redeemable for the Groovebook Service in countries where the service is offered in the currency denominated on the gift subscription. Gift subscriptions are assigned a fixed monetary value (e.g., $35). The entire value of the gift subscriptions will be applied to your Groovebook Service account upon redemption. Gift subscriptions are not refundable (whether cash or otherwise), except to the extent required by applicable law. Gift subscriptions cannot be used to purchase other gift subscriptions, and cannot be reloaded, resold or transferred for value. Gift subscriptions will expire in the time period specified on the gift subscription. Title to the gift subscription and the risk of loss, destruction or deterioration pass to the purchaser upon purchase. We are not responsible for any gift subscriptions that are lost, stolen, destroyed or used without your permission. In the event a gift subscription is non-functional, your sole remedy, and our sole liability, will be the replacement of such gift subscription.</p>   
                
                <p>From time to time, other types of promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion. Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion. Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may be subject to certain restrictions as determined by us in our sole discretion. If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.</p> 
                
                <p>We may offer trials of the Groovebook Service for a specified period without payment (a "Trial"). We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability. For some Trials, we will require you to provide a Payment Method to start the Trial. At the end of such Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the Groovebook Service on the first day following the end of the Trial, on a recurring monthly basis. By providing a Payment Method in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge. You will not receive a notice from us that your Trial has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun. If you do not want this charge, you must cancel your Groovebook Service by contacting customer service at <a href="mailto:info@groovebook.com">info@groovebook.com</a> before the end of the Trial.</p>
                
                <p>The monthly subscription fee for the Groovebook Service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. We may contact you via e-mail if there is a problem with your Payment Method or you can view this information at any time in the mobile app. You may also contact customer service at <a href="mailto:info@groovebook.com">info@groovebook.com</a> at any time with any billing questions. In the event your paying subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Groovebook Service on January 31st, your next payment date will likely be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. </p>
                
                <p>Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used subscriptions. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Groovebook Service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p> 
                
                <p>We will make reasonable efforts to keep the Groovebook app operational. However, certain technical difficulties or maintenance may, from time to time result in temporary interruptions. We reserve the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Groovebook app, with or without notice, all without liability to you for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Groovebook app or any function or feature thereof. You understand and agree that we have no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Groovebook app.</p>
                
                <p>The Groovebook Service is developed by, or for, us and is designed to enable your Groovebook Service ready device to upload and create photo books. This software and your ability to upload photos may vary by device and medium, and functionalities may also differ between devices. By using the Groovebook Service, you acknowledge and agree to receive, without further notice or prompting, updated versions of the Groovebook Service and related third-party software. If you do not accept the foregoing terms, do not use the Groovebook Service. We do not take responsibility or otherwise warrant the performance of these devices, including the continuing compatibility of the device with our Groovebook Service. If your Groovebook Service ready device is sold, lost or stolen, please cancel the Groovebook Service immediately. If you fail to cancel your Groovebook Service, you will be responsible for recurring monthly charges until cancellation. Your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with the Groovebook product is to obtain a reprint or credit (to be determined at our discretion), and your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with the Groovebook Service is to stop using the Groovebook Service.</p>
                
                <p>The Groovebook Service is licensed, and not sold, to you for your personal and non-commercial use only, and we retain ownership of all copies of the Groovebook software applications even after installation on your device. We may assign these or any part of them without restrictions. You may not assign them or any part of them, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under this license, to any third party. We may terminate or restrict your use of the Groovebook Service, without compensation or notice if you are, or if we suspect that you are in violation of any of these Terms or engaged in illegal or improper use of the Groovebook Service.</p>

                    <li>Please note that, while you retain ownership of your User Submitted Materials, any template or layout in which you arrange or organize such User Submitted Materials through tools and features made available through any of our Sites and Apps are not proprietary to you, and the rights to such template or layout will remain with us.</li>
                    <li>You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise possess all necessary rights with respect to the User Submitted Materials, and that the User Submitted Materials do not and will not infringe, misappropriate, use or disclose without authorization or otherwise violate any copyright, trade secret right or other intellectual property or other property right of any third party, and that the User Submitted Materials are not unlawful, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable.</li>

If you do submit a submission that contains the likeness of an identifiable individual under the age of eighteen (18), we strongly encourage you not to include any identifying information (such as the individual's name or address) with such User Submitted Materials.</li>
                    <li>You agree that we may (but are not obligated to) filter any User Submitted Materials (including, without limitation, deleting or replacing expletives or other harmful or offensive language), refuse to use any User Submitted Materials (including, without limitation, suspending processing and shipping of any order relating to any User Submitted Materials) and/or disclose any User Submitted Materials and the circumstances surrounding the use thereof, to any third party in order to provide the applicable products or services, to enforce these Terms or to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.</li>

                <p>While we are not obligated to review User Submitted Materials for copyright infringement, we are committed to protecting copyrights and expect users of our Sites and Apps to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or through our Sites and Apps infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on our Sites and Apps; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href="http://www.copyright.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov</a> for details. DMCA notices and counter-notices regarding our Sites and Apps should be sent to:</p>

                <h2>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h2>
                
                <p>If you are a Shutterfly customer in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and Shutterfly agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Shutterfly service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Shutterfly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Shutterfly account.</p>
                
                <p>If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Shutterfly, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to Shutterfly must be addressed to: General Counsel, Shutterfly, Inc., 2800 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065 ("Notice Address"). If Shutterfly initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Shutterfly, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Shutterfly and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Shutterfly may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.</p>
                
                <p>You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org" rel="nofollow">www.adr.org</a>. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Shutterfly receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Shutterfly will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.</p>
                
                <p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org" rel="nofollow">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Shutterfly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your residence.</p>
                
                <p>If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Shutterfly's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Shutterfly did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Shutterfly will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
                
                <p>YOU AND SHUTTERFLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Shutterfly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.</p>
