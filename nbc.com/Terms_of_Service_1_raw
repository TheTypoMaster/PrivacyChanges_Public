<p class="Standard1L1">If you do not agree with any of these Terms of Service (“Terms of Service” or “Terms”), including the <strong><a href="privacy-policy" rel="nofollow"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a> </strong>incorporated herein, please do not use this Site or our online services.  By using this Site you will be deemed to have irrevocably agreed to these Terms.  Some areas of this Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which you should read carefully before making any use of those areas. Such additional terms will not change or replace these Terms regarding use of this Site, unless otherwise expressly stated.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service apply when you interact digitally with the Internet sites operated by NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“NBCUniversal” or “We”, “Our” or “Us”), (the “Site” or “Sites”), games, interactive TV, and any other services, products and any related software or mobile and/or tablet applications offered by NBCUniversal (collectively “online services” or “services”).  Note that in some instances, both these Terms of Service and separate additional terms or licenses, guidelines, rules or terms of service will apply to your use of some online services offered and/or operated by NBCUniversal (in each such instance, and collectively, “Additional Terms”). These Additional Terms will be posted in connection with the applicable online services and will be in addition to these Terms of Service.  Where any direct conflict exists between these Terms of Service, or any Additional Terms, and the applicable <a href="privacy-policy" rel="nofollow">Privacy Policy</a>,<strong> </strong>the terms of the Privacy Policy shall take precedence; however provisions unique to these Terms of Service (e.g., arbitration) will remain in effect as outlined here.</p>
<p>NBCUniversal may modify these Terms of Service prospectively from time to time in its sole discretion. Your continued use or accessing of the online services following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Service constitutes your acceptance of such changes. You agree to be notified of changes to the Terms of Service via posting of updates on the Site. </p>
<p>This is a general audience Site for adults.  We will assume (and by using this Site you warrant that) you have legal capacity to enter into the agreement set out in these Terms of Service (i.e., that you are of sufficient age and mental capacity and are otherwise entitled to be legally bound in contract).</p>
<p class="Standard1L1">To access this Site or some of the resources it has to offer, you may be asked to provide registration details.  It is a condition of use of these online services that all the details you provide be correct, current, and complete. If we at NBCUniversal believe the details are not correct, current, or complete, we have the right to refuse you access to the online services, or any of its resources, and to terminate or suspend your account.</p>
<p class="Standard1L1">Please note that these Terms may be revised and reissued, prospectively by posting updated terms on this Site.  You consent and agree to receive notices of updates of these Terms through our posting of updated Terms on the Site. You should visit this page regularly to review the current terms.  Your continued use of the Site will be deemed as irrevocable acceptance of any revisions.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE ONLINE SERVICES YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE OR ONLINE SERVICES (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.  Therefore, you should review the posted Terms of Service and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the online services (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms of Service (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the online services will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) except as mutually agreed.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised or Additional Terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You should frequently check the home page, your message account (if applicable) and the e-mail you associated with your account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable means of providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or additional Terms of Service by discontinuing use of the Site and related online services.</p>

<p class="Standard1L2">(a)            <strong><span>Wireless Features</span></strong>.  The online services may offer certain features and services that are available to you via your wireless device.  These features and services may include the ability to access the online services’ features and upload content to the online services, receive messages from the online services, and download applications to your wireless device (collectively, “<strong>Wireless Features</strong>”).  Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Wireless Features and certain Wireless Features may be incompatible with your carrier or wireless device. In addition, your carrier may charge you for standard messaging, data, and other fees to participate in Wireless Features.  Fees and charges may appear on your wireless bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance.  We have no responsibility or liability for any fees or charges you incur when using Wireless Features. You should check with your carrier to find out whether any fees or charges will apply, what plans are available and how much they cost.  You should also contact your carrier with any other questions regarding these issues.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(b)           <strong><span>Terms of Wireless Features</span></strong>.  If you register for any Wireless Features then you agree that, in connection with those Wireless Features, we may send communications to your wireless device regarding us or other parties.  Further, we may collect information related to your use of the Wireless Features in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  If you have registered via the online services for Wireless Features, then you agree to notify NBCUniversal of any changes to your wireless contact information (including phone number) and update your accounts on the online services to reflect the changes. </p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(c)            <strong><span>Location-Based Features</span></strong>.  For online services on mobile devices (“Mobile Apps”) when you use one of our location-enabled services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. Some of the Mobile Apps or online services require your location information for the feature to work. If you have enabled GPS, geo-location or other location-based features on a device, you acknowledge that your device location will be tracked and may be shared with others consistent with the <a href="privacy-policy" rel="nofollow"><strong><span>Privacy Policy</span></strong></a>.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">In addition, where any NBCUniversal Mobile App collects precise information about the location of your devices, it will be used to provide requested location services, and, depending on the particular Mobile App it may be used, amongst other uses, to allow tagging or to check-in.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">Some Mobile App(s) or feature(s) allow for you to disable location-based features or manage preferences related to them. However, you can terminate device location tracking by us by uninstalling any Mobile App(s) or feature(s).  The location-based services offered in connection with our Mobile App(s) or feature(s) are for individual use only and should not be used or relied on as an emergency locator system, used while driving or operating vehicles, or used in connection with any hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, or any other situation in which the failure or inaccuracy of use of the location-based services could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or property damage.  The location-based services are not suited or intended for family finding purposes, fleet tracking, or any other type of business or enterprise use – other non-NBCUniversal products exist today that may be used specifically for these purposes.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">Please see our <a href="privacy-policy" rel="nofollow">Privacy Policy</a> to find out more about how to opt out of providing location information or contact <a href="mailto:privacy@nbcuni.com" rel="nofollow">privacy@nbcuni.com</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(d)           <strong><span>Social Media Plug-Ins.</span></strong> Social media plug-ins of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus (amongst others) are integrated on our Site and other online services.  Where our online services contain a plug-in to a social network, these are clearly marked (e.g. with a Facebook button).  If you chose to click on one of these buttons or links, your browser connects directly to the servers of the relevant social network. The social network directly transmits the content of the plugin to your browser.

<p>We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us.  If those efforts fail, by using our Site or other online service, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against NBCUniversal, and any claim that NBCUniversal may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, or any NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration”) administered by JAMS or its successor (“JAMS”) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the “Applicable Rules”).  The Applicable Rules can be found at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>.  If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the “AAA”) instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the “Applicable Rules” in such circumstances).  If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, NBCUniversal agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 26, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below.  Furthermore, this Section 26 shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  You further agree that:</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(a)            <strong><span>Single Arbitrator.</span></strong>  The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and NBCUniversal (the “Arbitrator”);</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(b)           <strong><span>Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement.</span></strong>  The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or these arbitration provisions in Section 26 hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable;</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(c)            <strong><span>Location of Arbitration.</span></strong>  The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and NBCUniversal; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(d)           <strong><span>Governing Law</span></strong><strong>.  </strong>The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(e)            <strong><span>No Class Relief</span></strong>.  The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or NBCUniversal’s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(f)            <strong><span>Written Award</span></strong><span>.</span><strong>  </strong>The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an “Award”).  Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(g)            <strong><span>Arbitration Costs.</span></strong>  In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, NBCUniversal will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(h)           <strong><span>Reasonable Attorney’s Fees</span></strong><strong>.  </strong>In the event you recover an Award greater than NBCUniversal’s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award NBCUniversal’s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the Arbitration, but NBCUniversal shall in all events bear its own attorneys’ fees; and</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(i)             <strong><span>Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause</span></strong>.  With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor NBCUniversal shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(j)             <strong><span>Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice</span></strong>.  NBCUniversal may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after NBCUniversal has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from NBCUniversal Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(k)           <strong><span>Small Claims Matters are Excluded.  No Class Relief or Joinder of Claims.</span></strong>  Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against NBCUniversal in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.<br /><br /><br /><a name="27" rel="nofollow" id="27"></a><strong>27. </strong><strong>Dispute Resolution for Non-US Residents Only if a Tribunal has Ruled that Arbitration is Prohibited by Law</strong></p>
<p class="Standard1L1">This Section 27 applies to non-US Residents, where applicable law prohibits arbitration of disputes in accordance with Section 26.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(a)            <strong><span>Section 27 disputes</span></strong>.  If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the online services, the Content, these Terms of Service, whether heretofore or hereafter arising or to any of NBCUniversal’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (collectively, a “Section 27 Dispute”), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Section 27 Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.  Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 27(a).  Your notice to us must be sent to: </p>

<p class="Standard1L1">For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, NBCUniversal and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Section 27 Dispute, though nothing will require either you or NBCUniversal to resolve the Section 27 Dispute on terms with respect to which you and NBCUniversal, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(b)           <strong><span>Jurisdiction</span></strong><strong>.</strong> The parties agree that the state or federal courts in New York shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Section 27 Dispute.</p>
<p class="Standard1L2">(c)            <strong><span>Governing Law</span></strong><strong>.</strong>  To the maximum extent permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms of Service and any Section 27 Dispute arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes), will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the U.S. and the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of law provisions, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.</p>

<p class="Standard1L2">(e)            <strong><span>Injunctive Relief</span></strong><strong>.</strong>  The foregoing provisions of this Section 27 will not apply to any legal action taken by NBCUniversal to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the online services, any Content, your User Content and/or NBCUniversal’s intellectual property rights (including such NBCUniversal may claim that may be in dispute), NBCUniversal’s operations, and/or NBCUniversal’s products or services. <br /><br /><br /><a name="28" rel="nofollow" id="28"></a><strong>28. </strong><strong>Member Disputes</strong></p>
