                Thank you for visiting Alot.com. Alot.com is committed to protecting consumer privacy online.
                We believe that greater protection of personal privacy on the Web will not only protect consumers, but also increase consumer confidence and ultimately their participation in online activities.
                The purpose of our policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit our site, how we may use that information,
                whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of the information.
                Our site may contain links to other Web sites, including Web sites directed to children. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners,
                advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide links from our sites. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the Web site sponsor when linking to other Web sites.
                Alot.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
            

                How We Gather Information and Technologies We Use
            

                At Alot.com you can visit many pages on our site without physically taking any steps to provide information.
                Like most Web sites, we do collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.
                This section provides information about the information we collect and how the technologies we utilize work.
            


Cookies.

                        We use "cookies." The cookies we place on your computer are very small text files that uniquely identify your browser and may be sent to your computer or mobile device.
                        They are stored on your hard drive and communicate with our servers only when you are visiting our websites. We use cookies to improve the quality of Alot.com.
                        They allow us to monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and number of pages viewed. They also allow us to optimize Alot.com to make sure that we are delivering the best possible experience to our users.
                        Your web browser is likely already set to accept cookies, yet you may choose to block cookies in your web browserâ€™s settings. Note that blocking cookies may result in some features not being able to function properly.

                        Additionally, we allow third parties that display advertisements, search listings, and other content on portions of Alot.com to set and access their cookies on your computer
                        or device and any cookies are subject to the applicable third parties privacy policies and not ours. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information
                        (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to
                        Alot.com and other unaffiliated Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
                        These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
                        We also partner with a limited number of interest-based advertising companies to serve ads and/or collect certain information when you visit our websites.
                        Interest-based advertising companies may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information during your visit to our websites in order to help show advertisements on other websites likely to be more interesting to you.
