What This Privacy Policy Covers
This policy covers how Weebly, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Weebly," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives on www.weebly.com. We are not in the business of selling information about you: we use information shared with us for the sole purpose of running and improving our services. This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.
				Weebly, Inc. complies with the U.S.-E.U.

This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.  IP addresses, browser and session information may be used to

We will retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number, credit card type, name, address, and some other billing information, so that you may identify that card used in the future. We do not store your credit card number or CVV2; this information is discarded after your transaction has been processed.
