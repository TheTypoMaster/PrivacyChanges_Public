				<h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
				<p>This policy covers how Weebly, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Weebly," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives on www.weebly.com. We are not in the business of selling information about you: we use information shared with us for the sole purpose of running and improving our services. This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.
				Weebly, Inc. complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  Weebly, Inc. has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Weebly, Inc.âs certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.

				<h3>Information We Gather</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Weebly collects personal information when you register with us, use Weebly products or services or post content on a Weebly website or blog. This information is limited to your email address, username, and any information you post on your site. Your password is stored securely using a salted, variable work factor, one-way hash function.</li>
					<li>Weebly may also collect personal information if you enter into promotions or sweepstakes.</li>
					<li>
						As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.  IP addresses, browser and session information may be used to
						<ul>
							<li>Diagnose and prevent service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</li>
							<li>Estimate the total number of users visiting Weebly's web sites from specific geographical regions.</li>
							<li>Help determine which users have access privileges to certain content, services or resources that we offer.</li>
							<li>Monitor and prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>We also collect other user information as part of our internal analytics services, in order to improve the services.</li>
					<li>Weebly may collect billing information if you sign up for a paid service, which may include your name, address, telephone number, credit card details, and other information that is necessary in order to process the transaction. Under no circumstance do we store any of your sensitive billing details.</li>
					<li>When signing up for the affiliate program, Weebly may collect additional details in order to process payments and comply with tax law, which may include your social security number or EIN, your address, and other information as appropriate.</li>
					<li>Weebly uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, support, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Billing information</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Should you sign up for a Weebly premium account, register a domain through us, or purchase another premium service, we require your billing information in order to process the transaction.</li>
					<li>We will retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number, credit card type, name, address, and some other billing information, so that you may identify that card used in the future. We do not store your credit card number or CVV2; this information is discarded after your transaction has been processed.</li>
					<li>If your subscription is auto-renewing, Authorize.net will store your credit card information on their secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.</li>
					<li>All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit encryption.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>
				<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Weebly and our affiliates, partners and service providers such as marketing and customer support partners, and service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking usersâ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
				<p>We use cookies for a number of purposes such as for our shopping cart, to remember usersâ setting such as language preferences, and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
				<p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 technologies to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity also use LSOs such as HTML 5 technologies to collect and store information.</p>
				<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.  For more information about targeted advertising specifically, or to opt out of having your browser information used for these purposes, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.  You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

				<h3>Information Relating to Children</h3>
				<p>Individuals under the age of 13 are prohibited from creating or using accounts through Weebly.com. Students under the age of 13 may, however, use Weebly through special student accounts created by their teachers through education.weebly.com, provided the teacher has obtained signed parental consent from the student's parents.</p>

				<h3>Information Use, Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Weebly does not share personal information we learn about you from your use of the Weebly web sites, products and services with others except as described in this policy.</li>
					<li>We do not share, sell, rent or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</li>
					<li>Weebly may use or share your personal information where it is necessary to complete a transaction, to operate or improve the Weebly products and services, or to do something that you have asked us to do. We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for promotional purposes.</li>
					<li>From time to time, Weebly or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on Weebly. You may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. This information will be used strictly for the purpose of notifying and arranging delivery of promotional items to the person selected.</li>
					<li>You may opt out of emails you receive from Weebly or any of our partners for promotions, sweepstakes, contests or newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or by visiting http://www.weebly.com/weebly/unsubscribe.php.</li>
