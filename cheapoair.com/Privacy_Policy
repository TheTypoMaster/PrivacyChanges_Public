We may share your personally identifiable information with our parent company, corporate affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to CheapOair.com. Our parent company, all of our affiliates and subsidiaries share our commitment to protect your personally identifiable information and comply with a policy at least as restrictive as our Privacy Policy.
Your personally identifiable information may be shared with our suppliers such as airlines, hotels, car rental partners, insurance suppliers, and/or activity, service providers or intermediaries (collectively, "Suppliers") who are directly or indirectly involved in providing you with services or other products you purchased from our Sites. By making a reservation on our Sites or through our mobile application, you authorize us to disclose to such Suppliers the information they require to verify your identity, complete the booking and deliver the services or products you purchased. In certain cases, Suppliers may use your personally identifiable information to prevent fraud and improve their service or product. These Suppliers are not controlled by CheapOair and any personally identifiable information disclosed to them is subject to their own privacy policies. As such, please review the privacy policy of each Supplier whose products you purchase through our Sites or mobile application.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies 


Cookies are data files which can be stored on your computer's hard drive, if your web browser allows it. Our Sites and mobile application use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts for the following purposes:

To help us to recognize you as a previous visitor on the Sites. For example, if you have an account with CheapOair.com, we use cookies to store your login information, so you will not need to enter your credentials each time your browser visits us to login to your account.
To enable us to customize your user experience with us, as well as the help customize ad content provided to you on other sites across the Internet. As an example, when you access a page on our Sites, a cookie is automatically set by us, our marketing partners or service providers to recognize your browser when you visit other websites and to present you with information and advertising content based on your apparent interests.
To help research, test and measure our Site's features and offerings, advertisements and related email campaigns.

While most browsers include the option of preventing the browser from accepting new cookies, please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access certain tools and functionalities offered by our Sites. 

In addition to cookies, CheapOair may use Web Beacons and Local Shared Objects to monitor traffic patterns, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand if you were referred to us from an online advertisement, to help measure the effectiveness of our offerings and advertisements, to help us understand which emails from us have been opened and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site and mobile application.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information about you automatically and store it in our log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and /or clickstream data. 

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We collect and use this information to improve services we offer you, to improve our marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

We may use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information.

If you reject cookies, you may still use the Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Sites may be limited.

We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Sites and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served generic ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Mobile Analytics 


We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.


 Return to Top



Security 


The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number, date of birth, and/or geo-location data) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link.

All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (AES with 128 and 256 bit secret key). While the secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download. Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time.

If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers. As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server.

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personally identifiable information when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us.
