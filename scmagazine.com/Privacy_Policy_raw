    <strong>US Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p>
    Haymarket Media Inc. ("Haymarket") has created this privacy statement to
    demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose
    what information we collect and how we use it. Please note your use of our
    Digital Offering is also governed by the Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Information Collection and Dissemination </strong>
    </p>
    <span><strong>General Principles </strong></span>
    <ul>
        <li>In general, you may visit this site or use the companion mobile applications (collectively referred to as the "Digital Offering") without identifying yourself or revealing any Personal Information.</li>
        <li>As you browse our Digital Offering, the Digital Offering collects log file, IP address of your computer,
            and other standard tracking data we use to evaluate Digital Offering traffic and usage patterns. Such
            information is aggregated with tracking data from all Digital Offering visitors. We will use the
            information to personalize the Digital Offering according to your preferences based on the
            aggregated information. We also use the aggregated information to evaluate products and services
            we may offer to you and share it with third party advertisers and sponsors so that they may provide
        more tailored product offerings.</li>
        <li> Some portions of this Digital Offering may require you to give us personally
            identifiable information such as your name, job title, company, physical
            mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (Personal
            Information) and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit
            card information (Financial Information), for, without limitation, (i)
            registration for attendance at certain Haymarket trade shows, conferences and
        events; and (ii) subscriptions to our publications.</li>
        <li>
            If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or
            forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, any information provided in
        such communications may be collected as Personal Information.</li>
        <li>If you elect to provide us with Personal Information, we use it primarily to deliver the service you requested.  In order to deliver our services we may append information provided to us by third
        parties to help us provide you with a more relevant user experience.</li>
        <li>Other uses of Personal Information are described elsewhere in this Policy.</li>
        <li>If you submit Financial Information, we use that information primarily to verify your credit and collect payments for your purchases, orders, registrations etc. </li>
        <li> Haymarket uses a third party to process credit card transactions and does not
            store financial information, such as credit card information on its websites.
            For some transactions, we will retain the last four digits of the credit card number solely for
            customer service purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Information usage</strong>
    </p>
    <p>We will use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:upper-roman;">
        <li>to provide you with the products and services you have requested and to communicate with you about those products and services</li>
        <li>to design additional services or products for customers' use</li>
        <li>to let you know about any products or services which we believe may be of interest to you.  You will always be able to unsubscribe or opt-out of receiving these messages</li>
        <li>to work with our business partners, sponsors, advertisers and affiliates to provide you with information you have selected or that we feel may be of interest to you Unsubscribing is easy if the information is no longer useful to you.  These arrangements help us to provide some of our services for free</li>
        <li>to invite you to participate in sponsored informational programs</li>
        <li>to provide you with advertisements, promotions or sponsored content based on information connected to your personally identifiable information such as your profession and specialty</li>
        <li>invite you to share your opinions and comments</li>
        <li>to conduct surveys  and/or market research</li>
        <li>purposes related to any of the above or as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Information Sharing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal
    Information and your Financial Information private and will not share it with
    third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court
    order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce
    our terms of service.
    </p>
    <p>Unless you opt-out, we may share your Personal Information with Haymarket's
    affiliates, partners and third parties licensed or permitted to access your Personal
    Information by any of the foregoing.
    </p>
    <p>We may share information about your engagement with any of our services including receipt and/or
    action with our emails, activity on our sites including content and/or advertisements viewed and
    actions taken or personal information otherwise provided by you.
    </p>
    <p>We may invite you to participate in industry-sponsored programs which present you with branded
    sponsor-selected materials  to provide clinical information to physicians about medical conditions,
    options for treatment and recommended products.  Your invitation will use the Personal Information
    that you have provided or that we have obtained from third parties, and non-personally identifiable
    information which we gather from your site visits by the use of cookies or other tracking
    technologies.  Sponsor programs will be affiliated with your area of specialty and any specific
    interests you have shared with us.   Not everyone will qualify for an invitation to participate;
    conversely you may be invited to register or participate in more than one program.  Haymarket will provide
    information, personally identified information or in aggregated form, about your participation in
    specific  programs to the program sponsor or their representatives.  This helps our industry
    sponsors to improve clinical education and information and communicate with you in a more
    targeted way.  If you interact with any of our sponsors directly, their Privacy Policy and practices will
    apply.
    </p>
    <p>We will share your Personal Information with our third party suppliers who need to process you data
    to deliver the services you have requested or consented to receive.  These suppliers are required
    under contract not to use Personal Information supplied by us other than to provide the services requested by
    us and to guarantee to our satisfaction that they have sufficient processes in place to ensure the
    security of your data whilst it is in their care.  You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal
    Information with our contractors and third party service supplies for the purpose of providing
    services to you.
    </p>
    <p>Haymarket will share user data with the accredited provider(s) of CME/CE activities
    in which users participate, and/or medical education and communications
    companies who assisted in the development of CME/CE activities in which users
    participate.
    </p>
    <p>In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide
    lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Haymarket products
    to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies send
    on Haymarket's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to
    our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be
    supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file. If you
    continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:custserve@haymarketmedia.com">custserve@haymarketmedia.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Aggregated information</strong>

    this Digital Offering to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Information on Children</strong>
    </p>
    <p>

    are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also
    for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags
    provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by
    changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there
    are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most
    advertisements.
