These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access and use the Products (“Users”).By accessing or using the Products you agree to be bound by these Terms.Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms supersedes or limits your rights under (1) the terms and conditions of any written agreement you have entered into with Blackboard regarding the use of Products, or (2) applicable laws or regulations to the extent these Terms are prohibited by such laws or regulations.  In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions of an applicable written agreement you have entered into with Blackboard, the terms and conditions of the written agreement shall control.




                     1. Basic Terms and Accounts

Your account with Blackboard (and use of the Product) gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Products on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. You may use the Products only in compliance with these Terms, any agreement entered into by your institution relating to the Products, and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.In cases where you have authorized or registered another individual, including a minor, to use your account(s), you are fully responsible for (i) the online conduct of such user; (ii) controlling the user’s access to and use of the Products; and (iii) the consequences of any misuse. Blackboard requires that the parents, guardian, or other authorized adult of a minor affirmatively consent to the use of a Blackboard Product by such minor.
