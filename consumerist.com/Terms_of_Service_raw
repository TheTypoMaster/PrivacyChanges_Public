Consumers Union is an expert, independent, nonprofit organization whose mission since its founding in 1936 has been to work for a fair, just, and safe marketplace for all consumers and to empower consumers. To maintain independence and impartiality, Consumer Media, like Consumers Union, accepts no outside advertising, no free test samples, and has no agenda other than the interests of consumers.</p>
<p>Please read this User Agreement carefully, because by using this Site and/or by installing or using our Tipster mobile software, services and applications (“Tipster App”), you agree to be bound by and comply with its terms.</p>
<p>I. Privacy Policy<br />

<p>Consumer Media also grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right to access, use, and display our Site and to download or print Site Content for personal, non-advertising purposes. If you download or print files, images, or any other Site Content, you may not alter the Site Content, or remove any trademark, copyright or other notices displayed on the Site.</p>
<p>In keeping with our non-profit mission, our Site Content is intended solely for the benefit of consumers in order to help them make informed choices and decisions about consumer products, services, and other consumer matters. We champion the rights of consumers and guard against commercial interactions that might call that goal into question. As a result, we do not allow the Site Content to be used to advertise or promote commercial services or products of other individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>What does this mean?<br />
If you link to our Site, republish excerpts of our Site Content, or e-mail them to others for personal, non-commercial purposes – for example, commentary or reporting in your personal blog, or educational and informative purposes for the benefit of you, your family, friends, students and communities – that’s fine with us. But you can’t republish our entire Site or large portions of it, use our Site Content to sell products or services (either your own or someone else’s), use our Site Content in advertising, or otherwise make money from it.<br />
We acknowledge that others share our public education goals and may wish to use the Site Content in non-commercial ways other than those outlined above or in commercial ways that are consistent with the mission of our Site. If you aren’t sure whether your intended use of our Site Content fits within the non-commercial scope we’ve outlined above or if your intended purpose is commercial (for example, you wish to re-publish significant portions of Site Content in your upcoming book), then contact us first for permission by sending an email to permissions@consumermediallc.org identifying (1) the Site Content you wish to re-publish, (2) your contact information, and (3) your intended use of the Site Content.

III. Notice of Copyright Infringement<br />
We intend that all Site Content respect the copyright and other proprietary rights of third parties. When visitors post content on our Site, we are unable to monitor the copyright ownership of all posted content. If at any time you believe that any of our Site Content infringes your copyrighted material, then you may request the content be removed from our Site in accordance with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) and procedures described below.<br />
You must send a notice that complies with the Copyright Act (“Notice”) to the agent we have designated with the Copyright Office:<br />
Consumer Media LLC 101 Truman Avenue, Yonkers, New York 10703-1057 Attn: Wendy Wintman<br />
Your Notice must be in writing and must include:<br />
1. A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;<br />
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;<br />
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;<br />
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;<br />
5. A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and<br />
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>When we receive a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, we will remove the identified material promptly. We will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the user who posted the allegedly infringing material (the “alleged infringer”) of the Notice and subsequent removal. The alleged infringer may then provide us with a counter-notice (“Counter-Notice) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous. Such Counter-Notice must be in writing and must include:</p>
<p>A. A physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer;<br />
B. Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;<br />
C. A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or access to it disabled as a result of error;<br />
D. The alleged infringer’s name, address, and telephone number; and<br />
E. A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents to service of process from the complaining party or its agent.</p>
<p>We will notify you of the Counter-Notice upon our receipt and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days thereafter unless you inform us that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our Site.</p>
<p>Please note: the contact information of our Designated Agent is intended specifically for the receipt of notices of claimed infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, 17 U.S.C. § 512. If you have general inquiries, please email us at legaldept@consumer.org</p>
