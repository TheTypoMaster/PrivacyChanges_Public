<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>
So that you can better protect your privacy, Thomas Industrial Network, Inc. ("THOMAS") provides this 
Privacy Statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the 
way your personal information is collected and used. By using this website, you accept the practices 
that are described in this Privacy Statement, which is part of the 
<a href="/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> governing the use of this website and 
the terms and conditions governing any other THOMAS service you use. If, however, any area within or 
feature offered by this website or other THOMAS website or service sets forth a separate or additional 
privacy statement, terms and conditions or other policy, then that separate privacy statement, terms 
and conditions or other policy shall apply in connection with that area, feature, website or service. 
This Privacy Statement does not apply to personal information that is collected through the websites or 
other services of THOMAS or its affiliates based outside the United States of America or through any 
services offered by THOMAS or its affiliates outside the United States of America.
</p>

<p>
If you do not agree with the practices explained in this Privacy Statement, do not complete the Sign-Up 
for MyThomas form, create a MyThomas profile, contact us using the "Contact ThomasNet" link on this 
website or submit any personal information through this website or other THOMAS service.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: Without signing up for MyThomas, you cannot access certain features of this website.
</p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>
At times, you may voluntarily give us or THOMAS will ask you to provide personal information. For example, 
you will be prompted to supply us with personal information when signing up to use MyThomas, accessing 
certain features of this website or other THOMAS services or initiating communication through this website 
or other THOMAS services. We will use your personal information to, among other things, help customize your 
site experience, enhance our services and facilitate communications with you or between you and the companies 
that are a part of THOMAS' database of companies and are listed on this website ("Suppliers") and any other 
third parties that advertise on this website or provide services, features or information in connection with 
this website or to THOMAS ("Providers").
</p>

<p><strong>Sign Up - MyThomas</strong></p>

<p>
While you do not need to sign up to use this website, you do need to sign up for a MyThomas account to 
access certain features of it. In those instances, you may be asked for personal and demographic information, 
including your Name, E-mail Address and Company Name, and you also will be required to choose a username and 
password that will be used to gain access on subsequent visits to MyThomas. This information will constitute 
your user profile. While most of your user profile is used internally for site analysis and improvement and 
other business purposes, some of it is used in compiling reports (see "Reporting" below) for Suppliers, Providers 
and our affiliates, agents and contractors and in connection with other THOMAS services. However, except as 
provided or permitted in this Privacy Statement, THOMAS will not disclose, without your consent, or associate 
with your site usage, any of your personal contact information provided through your MyThomas account. You may 
edit or change your user profile at any time by logging into MyThomas. If you wish to delete your user profile, 
use the "Contact ThomasNet" link and ask that your MyThomas account be deleted.
</p>

<p><strong>Control of Your Password</strong></p>

<p>
You are responsible for all actions taken with your MyThomas username and password. Therefore, we do not 
recommend that you disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your username and 
password with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your MyThomas account. If you 
lose control of your password, you may lose control over your information (including, but not limited to, 
information provided when signing up for a MyThomas account or requesting quotes), data, text, software, 
music, sound, photographs, images, graphics, videos, messages, logos or other materials (collectively, "Content"), 
whether publicly posted on (including any forums or other public areas) or privately transmitted through (whether 
to us, other users, Suppliers or Providers) this website, and may be subject to legally binding actions taken 
on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change 
your password.
</p>

<p><strong>Communicating With Suppliers and Providers</strong></p>

<p>
When you use the communication features and software applications on this website to initiate contact with 
Suppliers or Providers, you may be asked to supply contact information required by these companies to respond 
to your request to contact you. Depending on how you wish the Supplier or Provider to respond to your request, 
you may be asked to provide certain personal information, including one or more of the following: Name, Telephone 
Number, Fax Number, Mailing Address and E-mail Address. We will only forward a Supplier or Provider the contact 
information you provide.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to call the phone number listed on this website for a Supplier, your phone contact information, 
including such information as your Phone Number and your Name and Location, may be collected and provided to the 
Supplier. Additionally, the call may be monitored or recorded if a recorded message or other notification is 
provided at the beginning of the call to this effect, and the recording made available to the Supplier. THOMAS 
and its affiliates, agents, contractors or service providers may also monitor, store, review and access such 
information and call recordings and use them in connection with the provision of services to Suppliers or for 
business and marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, many Suppliers and Providers may make certain services, information and software applications, 
such as CAD Drawings or White Papers, available to the users of this website free of charge. Some of these 
Suppliers and Providers may require that you provide your contact and personal information in exchange for 
access to these services, information and applications. If you do not provide the required information, you 
will not be able to access these services, information and applications. Once information has been provided 
to a Supplier or Provider, it is out of the control of THOMAS and subject to the policies of that Supplier 
or Provider.
</p>

<p><strong>Communications from THOMAS</strong></p>

<p>
By signing up for a MyThomas account and providing us with your e-mail address, you agree that THOMAS may 
communicate with you via e-mail concerning the services and operations of THOMAS and this website, including, 
but not limited to, confirmation, additions or deletions to services, notifications of product enhancements, 
notifications of service interruption and changes to this Privacy Statement, this website's 
<a href="/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> or other THOMAS policies. By default, 
users who sign up are "Opted Out" of and will not receive other communications from THOMAS unless they 
choose to. As part of the MyThomas sign up process, and at any time thereafter, you will have the opportunity 
to opt in to receive other communications, including newsletters and announcements, from THOMAS, its affiliates, 
Suppliers or Providers via e-mail by checking the appropriate boxes on the Sign Up/Update Form. All such 
communications from THOMAS will contain a link or instructions for opting out of future communications. 
Please Note: To comply with the United States CAN-SPAM act, opting out from future communications from a 
company or entity will require that your e-mail address be given to that company or entity so that it may 
be added to the company's or entity's "do not mail" list.
</p>

<p><strong>Communications from Other Users</strong></p>

<p>
You agree that other users may use your Content posted on this website or other THOMAS services (whether on 
forums or other public areas) or obtained through a related communication or transaction to communicate with 
you in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Services</strong></p>

<p>
This website may offer services from or in conjunction with other websites, Suppliers or Providers that we feel provide valuable services to our users. Some of these services require registration. As a time saving tool, to save our users unnecessary data entry and to enhance the services offered, we offer to pass certain of your information, including your user profile, to these other websites, Suppliers and Providers. In addition, your use of any software applications, purchasing tools or other services labeled on this website as "Powered by" an entity other than THOMAS will constitute your consent to our sharing of information about you, including your personal information and user profile, with that entity. Once information has been shared with a particular website, Supplier or Provider, it is out of the control of THOMAS and subject to the policies of that website, Supplier or Provider.
</p>

<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>

<p>
This website may set cookies on your computer. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your computer by our 
web server and helps recall your use of this website. Cookies are uniquely generated and assigned to you. The

advertisements within our website. These companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file. 
Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience 
segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the 
description of the audience they are trying to reach. We only authorize our third-party ad servers 
to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. These third-party ad servers do 
not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. If you 
want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently 
you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt-out (if they offer this capability). 
Currently, we have relationships with <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline; font-style:italic;">BBN Networks, Inc.</span> 
and <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline; font-style:italic;">Bizo Inc.</span>.

Additionally, You have the ability to control any website's ability to set cookies on your computer through your 
web browser's (i.e. Firefox or Internet Explorer) privacy settings. Consult the documentation or help files for 
your web browser for instructions on setting cookie preferences. However, if you do not accept cookies you will 
not be able to customize your experience on this website.
</p>

<p><strong>OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>

<p>
Additionally, THOMAS may keep track of technical information about your computer or mobile device, such as the 
browser type and version, browser plug-in types and versions and operating system of your computer; the Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) or other provider you use to access this website, links on this website and certain of 
our services; and your internet protocol (IP) address, location and time zone setting. To help us understand 
the use of this website by users, improve your site experience and aid us in marketing and managing this website 
and our services, we may also collect information as to how you were directed to this website and our services, 
how you navigate around them, what products or suppliers you browse, which external websites or links you access 
from this website and details regarding the Suppliers or Providers you contact through this website. This 
information may be used, among other things, in the reporting, marketing and analysis of this website and 
its services and features and may be shared with our affiliates, Suppliers, Providers and/or their and our 
respective agents and contractors.
</p>

<p><strong>LOGGING</strong></p>

<p>
We make extensive use of web logging to, among other things, understand the usage of our services, 
diagnose problems and identify future enhancements to this website. In addition to logging the pages 
viewed and features used, our logs will also collect referring IP addresses or domain names of users. 
This information is used, among other things, in the reporting, marketing and analysis of this website 
and its services and features and may be shared with our affiliates, Suppliers, Providers and/or their 
and our respective agents and contractors.
</p>

<p><strong>WEB BEACONS</strong></p>
<p>
Pages on this website may contain web beacons, sometimes called single-pixel gifs, that allow us to 
count users who have visited certain pages. Web beacons may be used in conjunction with such features 
as promotional e-mail messages, online advertising and newsletters. Web beacons collect only a limited 
set of information and are not used to access your personal information on this website.
</p>
<p><strong>REPORTING OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>
THOMAS is able to offer this website for free on the Internet as a direct result of the paid support 
of the Suppliers and Providers who provide information, applications and other services and advertise 
on this website. As a result, we provide these Suppliers and Providers with personal information as 
described above as well as aggregate information; we also provide them with reports of non-personally 
identifiable information collected on the usage of this website and various features, and information 
provided during the MyThomas sign up process, which may include information such as your company name, 
job function, industry or city.
</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>
It is possible that THOMAS, part of its business or one of its affiliates could merge with, acquire or 
be acquired by another business entity and your personal information could be among the assets transferred. 
If this occurs, you will be notified of the change by e-mail, notice on this website or one of our other services.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to share personal information about you with our affiliates in the course of our 
business operations. We also reserve the right to share personal information about you when we believe 
this to be appropriate to comply with the law or in cooperation with legal authorities, to enforce the 
<a href="/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> governing use of this website and the 
terms and conditions governing the use of our other services, or to protect the rights, property, safety 
or other interests of THOMAS, its affiliates or its customers.
</p>
<p>
We may share non-personal, non-individually identifiable information about our users with the group of 
people with whom we share personal information, as well as with other third parties such as agents, 
contractors, consultants, advertisers and marketing firms.
</p>
<p><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>
We use reasonable precautions to keep user information disclosed to us secure. To prevent unauthorized 
access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place 
commercially reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the 
information we collect.
</p>
<p>
We may disclose information we collect to third parties, under contract to us, as required to operate 
this website, provide certain services or features offered by this website or THOMAS or to perform 
business functions on our behalf. We will only release this information to those companies that we 
believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions 
of any third parties who receive the information. Also, once information has been provided to a third 
party, it is out of the control of THOMAS and subject to the policies of that third party.
</p>
<p>
We also link to a wide variety of other websites. We are not responsible for their terms and conditions 
or privacy policies or how they collect or treat information about their users. In addition, we are not 
responsible for the terms and conditions or privacy or information collection policies or practices of 
the websites from which you access this website or other THOMAS service or of any websites that are linked 
to this website or other THOMAS service.
</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>

This website and its related features are not intended for use by children, and the terms and conditions 
governing the use of this website and its features require that you must be at least 18 years old to use them.
</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>
We reserve the right to modify or add to this Privacy Statement from time to time without notice. Such 
modifications and additions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by any 
means, including without limitation by email to the e-mail address of record in your MyThomas user profile 
or by posting the revised Privacy Statement on this website. You agree that it shall be your responsibility 
to review any email you may receive from us and notify us promptly in the event you change email accounts or

users of this website or other THOMAS service should review this Privacy Statement periodically and prior to 
any use. YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF THIS WEBSITE OR OTHER THOMAS SERVICE AFTER NOTICE OF MODIFICATIONS OR ADDITIONS

authorized officer of THOMAS.
