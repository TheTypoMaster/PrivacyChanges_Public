At times we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive promotions,
	products or services from third party sponsors. With your permission, Weather

	sponsors-we do the mailing for them. You will always have the opportunity to opt-
	out of receiving future offers by following the unsubscribe link included with each
	email. In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products
	and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services.

	explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your information
	is shared with the specific third party to enable them to provide you with the
	offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection
	practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by the
	privacy policies of these third parties. You should review the privacy policies of
	these parties before supplying personally identifiable information to them.
C. Third-Party Processors
When your information is collected on the Services, it may be collected directly
	by or shared with a selected third parties in connection with the operation of the

	that we provide to them only to carry out the service they are providing for
	Weather Underground. We require that the third party processors securely

	so that it can be accessed when needed for future purposes, and all such Third
	Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the personally identifiable
	information confidential.

	of our Services link to pages located on Web sites or services maintained by
	various other entities. In some cases you may link to pages of other Web sites
	that are framed with elements of our Services such as in the header or footer. In
	that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as
	advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click
	on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text,
	and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound

same level of protection as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen. By
using our Services and providing information to use, you consent to the transfer to
and processing of the information in the United States.
