<p>One of the most valuable assets of our business is you. Except as described below,
Weather Underground does not rent, sell or share personally identifiable information
about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies.</p>

	profile, facilitate updates to the Services, provide support, notify you if you've
	won a contest or sweepstakes, improve the working of the Services, and compile
	statistics about our users and your use of the Services. We and such third parties
	may on occasion combine information about you with information obtained from
	other parties to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you.
	If you sign up for communications from Weather Underground, they may also
	contain offers from third parties.</p>

	sponsors-we do the mailing for them. You will always have the opportunity to opt-
	out of receiving future offers by following the unsubscribe link included with each
	email. In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products
	and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services.
	In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you
	explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your information
	is shared with the specific third party to enable them to provide you with the
	offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection
	practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by the
	privacy policies of these third parties. You should review the privacy policies of
	these parties before supplying personally identifiable information to them.</p>

	<p>When your information is collected on the Services, it may be collected directly
	by or shared with a selected third parties in connection with the operation of the
	Services or the provision of services to you ("Third Party Processors"). These

	service, that organize, administer, process, or provide advertising services, and/
	or that analyze data on our behalf to help us provide more relevant offers to
	you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers as well as correcting and/or
	updating users' data based on information we provide them. We also provide your
	information to third party mapping service providers to provide you map content
	for the Services. Third party processors are authorized to use your information
	that we provide to them only to carry out the service they are providing for
	Weather Underground. We require that the third party processors securely
	store the personally identifiable information we provide to them and maintain it
	so that it can be accessed when needed for future purposes, and all such Third
	Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the personally identifiable
	information confidential.</p>

	<p>Like many Web sites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, many
	of our Services link to pages located on Web sites or services maintained by
	various other entities. In some cases you may link to pages of other Web sites
	that are framed with elements of our Services such as in the header or footer. In
	that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as
	advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click
	on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text,
	and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound
	by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection
	practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for
	example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use
	and disclosure of personally identifiable information.</p>
	<p>Some of our Services allow users to interface with other sites or services,
	including Facebook and Twitter. You will remain logged in to those other sites
	and services until you log off those sites and services. By proceeding with these
	interfaces, you are allowing our Services to access your information on those
	other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites' and services'
	Terms of Use. Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you
	post on those other sites and services may also post to our Services. Your use of
	those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and
	services, and not this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>Some of our Services use third party operating systems, platforms,
	communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device
	operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone and tablet devices), and
	some of our Services are provided by third party distributors, device makers,
	device operators, platform operators, and communication services. Weather
	Underground does not control these third party entities, products and services,
	and they may collect, use, process, transmit and disclose your information.

	Services, including our applications, in a manner that overrides your settings and
	preferences in our Services. As Weather Underground does not control or have
	knowledge of their data handling practices, we recommend that you review their
	privacy notices, terms of use and license agreements.</p>
	<p>E. Use by us of IP Addresses, Cookies, Web Beacons, Single-pixel Gifs,
	and Information Saved by Other Technologies</p>
	<p>Weather Underground and Third Party Processors acting on our behalf use various
	Internet technologies which help us to manage the operations of our Services
	and track usage behavior so that we can tailor information and advertisements
	to make your visits more enjoyable and meaningful. These Internet technologies

	track and analyze usage behavior, facilitate your access to and use of our
	services, serve, target, control, and measure advertisements on our Services,

	In addition, we may share demographic information, location data, IP address,
	aggregate (not individual) usage statistics for our Services, other identifiers and
	information with advertisers and other third parties. For example, we may share
	IP address, random or anonymous device identifier, city and state, ZIP code, and
	specific geo-location with the parties identified in subparagraph F below.</p>

	correct way to modify your cookies and HTML5 LocalStorage. If you turn Cookies

	features which make your experience more efficient and some of our Services will
	not function properly.</p>
	<p>Weather Underground contracts with certain Third Party Processors to track,
	analyze and report data about the usage of our Services using these Internet
	technologies. These Third Party Processors include Google Analytics, Paypal, and
	Omniture.</p>
	<p>F. Use of Cookies, Web Beacon and Other Technologies by Advertisers, Ad Networks, Ad Servers and Analytics Companies</p>
	<p>Weather Underground works with a variety of advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies. These advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies use various technologies, and technologies from third party companies, to collect data in order to send (or serve) relevant ads to users. These technologies may include the placement of cookies or web beacons, the use of HTML5 LocalStorage, the use of unique or non-unique non-personal identifiers, or the use of other technologies on our Services, and these technologies may be used to track user behavior, to track how our Services are being used, to link various devices you may use and possibly to serve you more relevant ads. These targeted advertisements may appear on our Services or other services that you visit. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of various technologies by advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies. These companies may also obtain information from services you use from and with other companies, including without limitation, other websites, mobile websites, mobile downloadable applications, downloadable applications, and other devices, and combine that information with information they obtain through these third party technologies on our Services.

	will likely be transferred as part of the sale. If we buy a business, we will honor
	the requests of that business' former customers regarding their personally
	identifiable information. If in connection with a sale there will be material changes
	to the way personally identifiable information is being used, affected consumers
	who have provided us with an email address will be notified via e-mail, if you
	have provided us an email address, and will be given the opportunity to opt-out.</p>

	or iv) where otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>3. E-mail a Friend</p>
<p>If you choose to use our service that allows you to e-mail parts of our Services to a

information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>4. Mobile Device Contacts</p>
<p>Some mobile products allow you to view weather conditions for people in your
phone's contact list. If you agree to use this feature, your contact list will be accessed
in order for us to provide weather information for your contacts who already have
their address, city, state, or zip code available. We do not store this information or
use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>5. Opting-Out, Corrections and Cancellations</p>
<p>If you receive an offer or promotion from Weather Underground or a third party
related to Weather Underground, you must have opted in. To ensure we have your
consent, we make sure that each e-mail sent to you by Weather Underground
presents the additional opportunity to opt-out of receiving future e-mails.</p>

password, update your personally identifiable information, correct information, make
changes to your preferences, unsubscribe to any e-mail subscriptions or opt-out
of certain services, by accessing your profile online at the member settings page
