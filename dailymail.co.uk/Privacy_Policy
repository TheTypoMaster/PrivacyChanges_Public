To make its advertising more relevant and effective, the network uses a range of technologies provided by third parties; many of which use cookies.Cookies are files that store small amounts of information on your computer or other device (for example, your mobile phone). None of the cookies that we use contain information such as your real name or address, so you cannot be identified personally by them. Some of the cookies used by our websites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf. Advertising servicesWe gather anonymous information such as on the types of pages visited, and keywords searched on in order to build an overall, but anonymous, picture of interests or preferences based on individual users browsing habits so that we can offer a more personal experience. To this information, we include information relating to a user’s country, region and connection type gathered from elements of the IP of the browsing device. This practice is a core method used by our group to make our online advertising more efficient for our advertisers and more relevant to consumers. With permission from our advertisers, we also collect information about their sites, for use on their advertising campaigns. This is often called Retargeting, or Remarketing, and involves showing ads to groups of users that have, for example, visited that client’s homepage.We will also gather information, still anonymously, on the users that reach an action page on an advertiser’s site. This allows us to monitor how many sales or actions we achieve for a client, and therefore how effective our advertising is.In order to know how many advertisements we serve, how many times these are clicked, how many advertisements we show to a given user and how many customer actions these generate, we use cookies when we show advertisements on a page. As well as our licensed ad servers, ads are also often served from third-party ad servers, such as those of media agencies, which all use cookies to track the same metrics as ours do.For more information about interest based advertising and how to turn this feature off, please see our cookies notice below. Ad verification technologyIn order to protect our advertisers’ brands, we often use a technology that scans the page to ascertain that it is safe from profane, sensitive & potentially brand-negative topics, before serving an ad there. This process is called Ad Verification, and these technologies use cookies to count ads served, those blocked, clicked and engaged by a user (i.e. they have hovered over them with their cursor).For a list of cookies served to specific A&N Media websites and MailOnline, please see our cookies notice below.   For more information about other cookies, please see our privacy policy and cookies FAQs.Safeguards and SecurityNo data transmission over the internet can be entirely secure, so we do not guarantee the security of your personal information and/or use of the Site. However, we use reasonable endeavours to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorised access or use by using encryption technology. In addition to these safeguards, your personal information is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998. This provides that the information which we hold about you should be processed fairly and lawfully, should be accurate, relevant and not excessive, not be retained for longer than is necessary and, if applicable, be kept up to date. For more information on the Data Protection Act 1998 and your related rights please see www.ico.gov.uk. Cookies noticeYou should be aware that when you use our websites, mobile sites, or mobile apps, we may collect information by using 'cookies'. If you'd like to learn how to manage these cookies and 'opt in' and 'out' of different types, please see our privacy policy and cookie FAQ. What are cookies and how do they work? Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you and can then tailor what you see on the screen.  What do you use cookies for? Cookies are an important part of the internet. They make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups: (i) Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for Some cookies are essential so you can move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you've asked for can't be provided. These cookies don't gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet. Here are some examples of essential cookies:Keeping you logged in during your visit; without cookies you might have to log in on every page you go to.When you add something to the online shopping basket, cookies make sure it's still there when you get to the checkout.Some are session cookies which make it possible to navigate through the website smoothly. However these are automatically deleted after you close your web browser.(ii) Improving your browsing experience These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features. Here are a few examples of just some of the ways that cookies are used to improve your experience on our websites:Remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences.Remembering if you've filled in a survey, so you're not asked to do it again.Remembering if you've been to the site before. If you are a first-time user, you might see different content to a regular user.Restricting the number of times you're shown a particular advertisment. This is sometimes called 'frequency capping'.Showing you information that's relevant to products of ours that you have.Enabling social media components, like Facebook or Twitter.Showing 'related article' links that are relevant to the page you're looking at.Remembering a location you've entered such as weather forecasts.(iii) AnalyticsWe like to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our sites and if they get 'error messages' from web pages. This group of cookies, often called 'analytics cookies' are used to gather this information. These cookies don't collect information that identifies you. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. Analytics cookies only record activity on the site you are on and they are only used to improve how a website works. Some of our websites and some of the emails you might get from us also contain small invisible images known as 'web beacons' or 'tracking pixels'. These are used to count the number of times the page or email has been viewed and allows us to measure the effectiveness of its marketing and emails. These web beacons are anonymous and don't contain or collect any information that identifies you. We also use 'affiliate' cookies. Some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. This works using a cookie. Learn how to manage your analytics cookies.(iv) Showing advertising that is relevant to your interestsWe sell space on some of our sites to advertisers. The resulting adverts often contain cookies. The advertiser uses the browsing information collected from these cookies to: restrict the number of times you see the same ad (frequency capping); and help show other ads that are relevant to you while you're on our websites. This is often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests. The OBA data collected from cookies you get when you're on our sites is only used to show relevant ads on our sites, not on other websites.Sometimes our websites contain ads for our own MailOnline or Daily Mail products. These ads use cookies in the same way as described above. So how does OBA work? Let's look at an example. Imagine you visit a website about travel. That website shows an advert and with that advert you receive a cookie. Imagine you then visit one of our websites which has an advert from the same advertiser you saw on the travel site. The advertiser will give you a new version of the cookie you received on the travel site. The advertiser can then use that cookie to recognise that you've previously been to a travel site and show you a relevant ad. Although the OBA data collected uses your browsing activity to understand your interests, the data is anonymous and isn’t linked to you as a person. Even if you log in to our websites, the OBA data is still not linked to you. Neither we, nor the companies who show ads on our sites sell data collected from cookies to any other organisations. It’s easy to control interest based advertising and manage your cookies if you want to.  For more information, see our ‘controlling interest based advertising and other third party cookies’ page or visit or our privacy policy and cookie FAQs.Device IdentifiersA Device Identifier is a tool with an equivalent function to that of a cookie which is used to target and track the effectiveness of content and advertising delivered to users of our mobile applications.You can reset your Device Identifier at any time through the Advertising settings on your iPhone, or opt out of sending this information by setting the ‘Limit Ad Tracking’ option located in the on your iPhone.Contacting us and accessing your personal informationAny queries or comments about this privacy notice or if you wish to review or receive copies of the personal information we hold about you should be sent to info@mailonline.co.uk or write to us at:  Legal Department.Associated Newspapers Limited Northcliffe House 2 Derry Street London W8 5TTUnited Kingdom We may charge a small administration fee (not exceeding the maximum permitted by law) in relation to fulfilling a request for access to personal information.
