Our services include showing you personalized content and advertising on Monster or other sites with which we have a business relationship. We may use your information to contact you about Monster updates, conduct surveys, or to provide informational and service-related communications, including important security updates.
Information you share in public areas of Monster or make visible in the resume and profile database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but we cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorized users store or transfer information you give to us, so you should not post sensitive information to Monster.
How We Share Information
We do not share contact information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.
We share your information with third parties who help us deliver our products and services to you. These third parties may not use your information for any other purpose.
We may share information to third parties if you consent. For example, we may use your information to contact you about products or services available from Monster or our affiliates. If you opt in, we may supply your information to third parties who may contact you about their products or services. You may change your contact preferences by adjusting your notification settings.
We may disclose to third parties information that we have collected from other websites.
We disclose information where legally required.
We may disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires any or all of Monster's business units.
How We Store Information
We store your information to make your interaction with Monster more efficient, practical, and relevant. You may access, review, correct, update, or delete your resume or profile any time by signing in to your account. If you do not have an account, please contact us.
When you delete your personal information, we will retain logs and non-personal information about your activity on Monster. We will also retain an archival copy of your information which is not accessible by you or third parties on the Internet. If your personal information was previously accessed by others using Monster, we are unable to delete the information from their systems.
