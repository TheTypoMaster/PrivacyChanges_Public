<h3>5. User Content and Submissions.</h3>
<p>You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, advertisements, messages or other materials submitted, posted or displayed by You on or through a Monster Site (&quot;User Content&quot;) is the sole responsibility of the person from which such User Content originated. Monster claims no ownership or control over any User Content. You or a third party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark and copyright to any User Content you submit, post or display on or through Monster and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying User Content on or through Monster, you grant Monster a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such User Content through Monster. In addition, by submitting, posting or displaying User Content which is intended to be available to the general public, you grant Monster a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such User Content for the purpose of promoting Monster and its services. Monster will discontinue this licensed use within a commercially reasonable period after such User Content is removed from Monster. Monster reserves the right to refuse to accept, post, display or transmit any User Content in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>You also represent and warrant that You have the right to grant, or that the holder of any rights, including moral rights in such content has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to You the right to grant, the license stated above. If You post User Content in any public area of any Monster Site, You also permit any User to access, display, view, store and reproduce such User Content for personal use. Subject to the foregoing, the owner of such User Content placed on any Monster Site retains any and all rights that may exist in such User Content. Monster may review and remove any User Content that, in its sole judgment, violates these Terms, violates applicable laws, rules or regulations, is abusive, disruptive, offensive or illegal, or violates the rights of, or harms or threatens the safety of, Users of any Monster Site. Monster reserves the right to expel Users and prevent their further access to the Monster Sites and/or use of Monster Services for violating the Terms or applicable laws, rules or regulations. Monster may take any action with respect to User Content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes that such User Content could create liability for Monster, damage Monster&rsquo;s brand or public image, or cause Monster to lose Users or (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs or other suppliers.</p>
<p>Monster does not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of User Content, derivative works from User Content, or any other communications posted by Users nor does Monster endorse any opinions expressed by Users.

    <li>harasses, incites harassment or advocates harassment of any group or individual;</li>
    <li>involves the transmission of &ldquo;junk mail&rdquo;, &ldquo;chain letters,&rdquo; or unsolicited mass mailing, &ldquo;spamming&rdquo; or &ldquo;phishing&rdquo;;</li>

</ul>
<p>Any Profile You submit must describe You, an individual person. Examples of inappropriate and prohibited Profiles include, but are not limited to, Profiles that purport to represent an animal, place, inanimate object, fictional character, or real individual that is not You.</p>
<p>You may not include, in any User Content submitted to Monster Networking, information that may be interpreted as a direct solicitation, advertisement or recruitment for an available job position directed to individuals seeking employment on either a full time or part time basis. In order to protect our Monster Community Users from commercial advertising or solicitation, Monster reserves the right to restrict the number of e-mails or other messages which a User may send to other Users to a number which Monster deems appropriate in its sole discretion.</p>

<h3>7. Policy Regarding Termination Of Users Who Infringe The Copyright Or Other Intellectual Property Rights Of Others.</h3>
<p>Monster respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our Users and content partners to do the same. The unauthorized posting, reproduction, copying, distribution, modification, public display or public performance of copyrighted works constitutes infringement of the copyright owners rights. As a condition to Your use of the Monster Sites, You agree not to use any Monster Site to infringe the intellectual property rights of others in any way. Monster reserves the right to terminate the accounts of any Users, and block access to the Monster Sites of any Users who are repeat infringers of the copyrights, or other intellectual property rights, of others. Monster reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take these actions to limit access to the Site and/or terminate the accounts of any time, in our sole discretion Users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement, with or without notice, and without any liability to the User who is terminated or to the User whose access is blocked. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that You believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against You, please contact Monster as set&nbsp;forth in Section&nbsp;6&nbsp;above.</p>
<h3>8. Monster's Liability.</h3>
<p>The Monster Sites act as, among other things, venues for (i) employers to post job opportunities and search for and evaluate job candidates and (ii) candidates to post resumes and Profiles and search for and evaluate job opportunities. Monster does not screen or censor the listings, including Profiles offered. Monster is not involved in, and does not control, the actual transaction between employers and candidates. As a result, Monster is not responsible for User Content, the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or resumes posted, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job openings and Monster makes no representations about any jobs, resumes or User Content on the Monster Sites. While Monster reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content, job postings, resumes or other material from the Monster Sites from time to time, Monster does not assume any obligation to do so and to the extent permitted by law, disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action.</p>
<p>Monster Networking provides a venue for individuals to network for professional and personal purposes and Monster does not screen or censor the Profiles or User Content on the Monster Sites. Monster is not involved in the actual communications between Users. As a result, Monster has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the Profiles or User Content submitted on the Monster Sites and makes no representations about any Profile or User Content on the Monster Sites.</p>
<p>Note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom You come in contact through the Monster Sites. By its very nature other people&rsquo;s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.
