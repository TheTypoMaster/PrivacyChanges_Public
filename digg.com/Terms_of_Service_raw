limitation, users who are contributors of content, information, and other materials
or services, registered or otherwise.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Modification</b>. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion,
to modify or replace any of these Terms of Use, or change, suspend, or discontinue
Digg (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database,

for ensuring that these Terms of Use are in compliance with all laws, rules and
regulations applicable to you. The right to access Digg is revoked where these
