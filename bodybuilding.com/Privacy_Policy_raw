<h2 class="article-sub-header" id="terms">Bodybuilding.com Terms Of Use</h2>



<h3 class="article-title" style="line-height: 33px!important;"><div class="circle">1</div> Introduction</h3>



<p>Welcome to the Internet sites of Bodybuilding.com. The Bodybuilding.com sites include Bodybuilding.com, <a href="http://bodyspace.bodybuilding.com/">BodySpace</a>, TeenBodybuilding.com, Bodybuilders.com, and other Internet sites on which these terms of use are posted.  Bodybuilding.com sites are collectively referred to herein as "Site," Sites," "we," "us" or "our."</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY SITE. By using any Site or by clicking a box that states that you accept or agree to these terms, you signify your agreement to these terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms of use, you may not use the Sites.</p>

<p>Note that special terms apply to some services offered on certain Sites, like rules for particular contests or sweepstakes or other features or activities. These terms are posted in connection with the applicable service. Any such terms are in addition to these terms of use, and in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms of use.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that these terms of use are supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge that such consideration includes your use of the Sites and receipt of data, materials and information available at or through the Sites, the possibility of our use or display of your Solicited Submissions (as defined below in Section 3, entitled "SUBMISSIONS") and the possibility of the publicity and promotion from our use or display of your Solicited Submissions.</p>

<h3 class="article-title" style="line-height: 33px!important;"><div class="circle">2</div> Use Of Content</h3>

<p>All information, materials, functions and other content (including Submissions, as defined in Section 3, entitled "SUBMISSIONS") ("Content") contained on Sites are our copyrighted property or the copyrighted property of our licensors or licensees. All trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are proprietary to us and/or our licensors or licensees. We may change the  Sites or delete Content or features at any time, in any way, for any or no reason.</p>

<p>Except as we specifically agree in writing, no Content from any Site may be used, reproduced, transmitted, distributed or otherwise exploited in any way other than as part of the Site, except that where a Site is configured to enable the download of particular Content, you may download one copy of such Content to a single computer for your personal, noncommercial home use only, provided that you (a) keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices, (b) make no modifications to the Content, and (c) do not use the Content in a manner that suggests an association with any of our products, services or brands. Any business use, "re-mailing" or high-volume or automated use of any Site is prohibited.</p>

<p>In the event that we offer downloads of software on a Site and you download such software, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the "Software") are licensed to you by us or third-party licensors for your personal, noncommercial home use only. We do not transfer title to the Software to you. You may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-readable form.</p>

<h3 class="article-title" style="line-height: 33px!important;"><div class="circle">3</div> Submissions</h3>

<p>In these terms of use, we use the word "Submissions" to mean text, messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons' names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other similar materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute (collectively, "Distribute") on or through a Site.</p>

<p>There are two types of Submissions: Solicited Submissions and Unsolicited Submissions. "Solicited Submissions" means those Submissions (a) that we expressly request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity on a Site for our review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or compensation (collectively, "Consideration") (such as prizes or other value in games, sweepstakes, contests and promotions); and (b) that you Distribute on or through any Site for which you do not seek Consideration (such as in our Forums (as defined below in Section 6, entitled "FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION")). "Unsolicited Submissions" are any and all Submissions that do not fall within subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph.</p>

<p>Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions so please do not Distribute Unsolicited Submissions on or through any Sites. We want to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. We therefore ask that you not Distribute any Unsolicited Submission. In any event, you agree that any Submissions you make is not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type (other than any stated Consideration).</p>

<p>Except as expressly stated in these terms of use, the provisions of these terms of use apply equally to Unsolicited Submissions and Solicited Submissions. Accordingly, we, our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled to exploit and disclose all Submissions, and we shall not be liable to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or disclosure of any Submission.</p>


<h3 class="article-title" style="line-height: 33px!important;"><div class="circle">4</div> Licenses And Representations</h3>

<p>You hereby grant us and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify (including removing lyrics and music from any Submission or substituting the lyrics and music in any Submission with music and lyrics selected by us), create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit such Submissions, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised (including on our Sites and third party web sites) for any and all purposes including entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity (the "Submissions License").</p>

<p>By communicating a Submission, you represent and warrant that the Submission and your communication thereof conform to the Rules of Conduct (set forth below in Section 7 labeled "RULES OF CONDUCT")) and other requirements of these terms of use and that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents and permissions, without the need for any permission from or payment to any other person or entity, to exploit, and to authorize us to exploit, such Submission in all manners contemplated by these terms of use (including the Submissions License). These terms of use (including the Submissions License) do not limit any past or future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers you may have made or make with respect to Submissions.</p>

<p>To the extent that any Submissions you Distribute on or through the Sites contain original songs or recordings, you hereby represent that you are a member of ASCAP, BMI, SESAC or any other applicable performing rights society and that all musical compositions (including lyrics) and sound recordings contained in such Submissions are available for licensing to us (and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users) directly from such societies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of whether you are a member of any performing rights society, you grant the Submissions License with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recordings contained in such Submissions.</p>

<p>To the extent that we solicit Submissions through features or activities on or through  Sites (including games, sweepstakes, contests, promotions and Public Forums (defined below in Section 6, labeled "PUBLIC FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION")) that require the use of our copyrighted works (in whole or in part), we hereby grant you a non-exclusive license to create a derivative work using our copyrighted works (in whole or in part) as required (but only as required, and only for the purpose of creating your Submissions); provided however, that such license shall be conditioned upon your assignment of all rights in the work you create to us. If such rights are not assigned to us, your license to create derivative works using our copyrighted works (in whole or in part) shall be null and void. You agree to the foregoing grant of rights, consents, agreements and assignments whether or not your Submissions are used by us.</p>

<p>You hereby appoint us as your agent with full power to enter into and execute any document and/or do any act we may consider appropriate to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers set forth in these terms of use.</p>

<p>To the extent any "moral rights," "ancillary rights," or similar rights in or to the Submissions exist and are not exclusively owned by us, you agree not to enforce any such rights as to us or our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, and you shall procure the same agreement not to enforce from any others who may possess such rights.</p>

<p>Without limiting the scope of the Submissions License or any future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments, and waivers you may make with respect to Submissions, you hereby ratify any prior grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers made by you with respect to Submissions submitted by you to us.</p>

For example, we are not responsible for, and we do not endorse, the opinions, advice or recommendations posted or sent by users in any Forum and we specifically disclaim any and all liability in connection therewith.</p>

<p>The state of California requires the following disclosure statement as of January 1, 2012, pursuant to the "Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010".</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Most nutritional supplements sold by Bodybuilding.com are manufactured in the U.S., in accordance with applicable U.S. labor laws.  Some ingredients are sourced from foreign countries but U.S. manufacturers are required (per Good Manufacturing Practices outlined at 21 C.F.R. 111.260) to test ingredients for purity prior to use in nutritional supplements.  
</p>
<p>
Bodybuilding.com is committed to conducting business in compliance with applicable law.  We exhibit and promote the highest standards of honest and ethical conduct in our dealings.  Our employees are expected to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity, and we recognize the important role manufacturers, ingredient suppliers and business partners play in helping us fulfill our commitment to ethical and responsible retailing.
</p>
<p>
Bodybuilding.com is a retailer not a manufacturer, but Bodybuilding.com is not aware of any unethical or illegal labor practices in connection with any ingredient sourced outside the U.S.  We do not audit and assess each product manufacturer's sourcing practice.  We are aware of the importance of ethical sourcing, and if we identify a product manufacturer who does not meet our expectations (including avoiding ingredients manufactured with trafficked labor), we will work with them to take corrective action or discontinue selling products manufactured by them.

<h3 class="article-title">Non-Personal Identification Information</h3>

<p>We collect non-personal identification information through the use of, without limitation, the following types of methodology:</p>

<p>"Cookie" technology: A "cookie" is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.</p>

<p>"IP address tracking": An "IP address" is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Sites, our servers log your IP address.</p>

<p>"Web beacons": A "Web beacon," or "clear gif," is a small graphic image on a webpage or web-based document that a website can use to determine information about a user.</p>

<p>Non-personal identification information might include the browser you use, the type of computer, technical information about your means of connection to our Sites such as the operating systems and the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information. Our systems may also automatically gather information about the areas you visit and search terms you utilize on our Sites and about the links you may select from within our Sites to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online.</p>

<p>We use such information for our business purposes, and, in particular, to administer the Sites, better manage advertising on the Sites, and, in the aggregate, to understand how our users as a group use the services, features and other resources provided on our Sites. This way we know which areas of our Sites are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our Sites.</p>

<p>We may share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties, but we will not share any individual names, personal navigational or other personal information. For example, we may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Sites. We may share demographic and preference information with this company to allow them to display appropriate advertisements for you. <!-- Please click here to see a list of certain third-party advertising companies and other partners of our Sites and links to their websites containing their privacy policies. --></p>

<p>We use a proprietary advertising server to display ads on our Sites. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Sites. Some of our advertisers may display ads on our Sites that may use cookie technology or Web beacons to (i) identify non-personal information about our users (such as connection speed, browser and country of origin) and (ii) track user behavior within our Sites. Advertisers generally use such information to customize the display of ads within our Sites. We will not permit such advertisers to collect any personal information from our users within our Sites, however, you may choose to voluntarily provide the advertisers with your personal information. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain.</p>

<p>Further, from time-to-time we contract with a third party web analytics provider to help manage and optimize our Sites. We use this service to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Sites. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookie technology on the Sites. The type of information we collect includes such information as the number of hits a webpage receives, type of browser used, and number of times a visitor makes a purchase from a particular promotion. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which products and services most interest our users, and what kinds of offers our users like to see. Although this third-party provider logs the information coming from our Sites on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.</p>
