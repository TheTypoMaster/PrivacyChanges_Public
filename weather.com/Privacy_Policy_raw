With your permission, The Weather Channel will periodically send to you, via e-mail, offers and promotions from our third party sponsors which we select based upon your interests or user profile. In this case we do not share your information with the third party sponsors-we do the mailing for them. You will always have the opportunity, to opt-out of receiving future offers by following the unsubscribe link included with each email. In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with the specific third party to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties. You should review the privacy policies of these parties before supplying PII to them.

These Third Party Processors may include, for example, companies that operate our online store, that process credit card information or handle shipping for The Weather Channel, that deliver materials to you via e-mail or postal service, that organize, administer, process, or provide advertising services, and/or that analyze data on our behalf to help us provide more relevant offers and advertising to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers as well as correcting and/or updating users' data based on information we provide them. We also provide your information to third party mapping service providers to provide you with map content for the Services. Third party processors are authorized to use your information that we provide to them only to carry out the service they are providing for The Weather Channel. We require that the Third Party Processors securely store the PII we provide to them and maintain it so that it can be accessed when needed for future purposes, and all such Third Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the personally identifiable information confidential.

In some cases you may link to pages of other Web sites that are framed with elements of our Services such as in the header or footer. In that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of PII.

Plug-ins, such as Facebook's "Like" button, "Comments" and "Facebook Connect", can be identified by logos associated with a third party service, and in practice are like a little piece of Facebook or Twitter embedded on the website. You will remain logged in to those other sites and services until you log off those sites and services. By proceeding with these interfaces, you are allowing our Services to access your information on those other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites' and services' Terms of Use. Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you post on those other sites and services may also post to our Services. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.

The Weather Channel does not control these third party entities, products and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit and disclose your information. For example, these third party elements may gather information from our Services, including our applications, in a manner that overrides your settings and preferences in our Services.

Certain pages on our website contain web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). A pixel tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), which is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on users' hard drives. These pixel tags collect anonymous data. These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.

In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects such as HTML5 LocalStorage on our website. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this site and cannot be accessed by other websites.
