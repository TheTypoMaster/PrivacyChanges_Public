Personal information









										In general, you can visit Lenovo on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.
									

										You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Lenovo that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so. This information is only used for the sole purpose of completing your request or for whatever reason it may have been provided.
									

										If you wish to subscribe marketing materials from Lenovo, we will use your name and email address.  Out of respect for your privacy, You may choose to stop receiving our marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us through the Privacy Submission Form.

Using and Sharing Personal Information









										The following paragraphs describe in more detail how Lenovo may use your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the type of Lenovo Web site you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may apply. For example, if you order a product from a Lenovo Web site, your information will be handled as described in such paragraphs as Fulfilling Your Transaction Request and Marketing Use.
									

										We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
									
























									 Back to top












Fulfilling your transaction request









										If you request something from an Lenovo Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of Lenovo, Lenovo?s Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.
									
























									 Back to top












Marketing Use

									 Back to top

										In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on a Lenovo Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae.

Information for Business Partners









										If you represent a Lenovo Business Partner, you may visit a Lenovo Web site intended specifically for Lenovo Business Partners. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Business Partner you represent, and Lenovo Business Partners generally. For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of Lenovo Business Partner programs. It may also include sharing certain information with other Business Partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or Lenovo customers or prospects. In connection with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.
									
























									 Back to top












Lenovo Supplier Administration









										If you represent a Lenovo supplier, you may visit a Lenovo Web site intended specifically for use by Lenovo suppliers. We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or performing a transaction with you. For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of Lenovo, Lenovo?s Business Partners, customers, shipping companies, financial institutions, postal or government authorities involved in fulfillment.

									 Back to top












Our Worldwide Practices









										Lenovo is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders.
									

										Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.
									

										We may share your personal information within Lenovo and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.
									

										Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries Lenovo will still handle information in the manner we describe here.
									
























									 Back to top












Information Security and Quality









										We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes both during transmission and once it is received, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.  If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at through the Privacy Submission Form.
									
























									 Back to top












Supplementing Information









										From time to time we may supplement information you give us via a Lenovo Web site with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.
									
























									 Back to top












Use of Suppliers









										In some cases Lenovo uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is Lenovo practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Lenovo policies.
									
























									 Back to top












Mergers and Acquisitions









										Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Lenovo decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise businesses in some countries, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Lenovo practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies









										As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Lenovo Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Lenovo or others on Lenovo behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.									
									

										Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.									
									

										We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some Lenovo pages use cookies, sent by Lenovo or its third party vendors, or other technologies such as, java scripts and e-tags to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.
									

										Some Lenovo Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Lenovo Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.
									

										If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded. For more information, please see "How to work with Cookies".


										We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information.
									

										Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html

























									 Back to top












Service Quality Monitoring









										Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is Lenovo general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.
									
























									 Back to top












Online Advertising









										We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. We or our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.  You will continue to receive generic ads
									
























									 Back to top












Personalized URL Link









										On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with Lenovo and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web site.
									

										If you choose to visit one of these Web sites, you are agreeing to let Lenovo collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with Lenovo. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.
									
























									 Back to top












Disclosures Required By Law









										Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
									
























									 Back to top












Privacy Technology









										Technology will increasingly help give you more control over your personal information. Products and services are available which can assist you with the control of your personal information while navigating the Web. See http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/rulesntools.shtml for an overview of many privacy-related tools. Please note that Lenovo has not formally evaluated these tools.
