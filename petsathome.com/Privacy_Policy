We endeavour to protect your information by:

Encrypting your personal information. When you place an order or access your   account information, your information will be sent through to us. A secure   server encrypts all of the information you input before it is sent to us. This   protects your confidential data, particularly your credit card details from   unauthorised use;   
  Keeping your information up-to-date and accurate. Please note that, to do   this, we require you to tell us if any of your details such as your name or   address change;and   
  Having in place strict security procedures for the storage and disclosure of   your information to prevent unauthorised access.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not   completely secure.

Once we have received your   information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to   prevent unauthorised access.

In performing these checks personal information provided by you may   be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of   that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your   identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will   be unaffected.
