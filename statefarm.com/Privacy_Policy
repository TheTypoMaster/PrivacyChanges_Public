Our Privacy Principles


We do not sell customer information.
We do not allow those who are doing business on our behalf to use our customer information for their own marketing purposes.
We contractually require any person or organization providing products or services on our behalf to protect State Farm customer information.
We do not share customer medical information with anyone within the State Farm family of companies unless:

You expressly authorize it; or


It is permitted or required by law; or


Your insurance policy contract with us permits us to do so.


We afford our prospective and former customers the same protections as existing customers with respect to the use of personally identifiable information.






We Protect Customer Information

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect nonpublic personal information and to comply with federal and state laws. In addition, we regularly review our policies and practices, monitor our computer networks, and test the strength of our security.





Information We Collect

Types of information we collect and how we gather it may include:

From your applications and other forms related to our products and through your conversations with State Farm representatives, including our agents
From your use of statefarm.com®, our mobile sites and applications, our social media sites and applications, and your interactions with our online advertisements
From your transactions or experiences with us, such as payments, underwriting, and claims
From within the State Farm family of companies
From non-State Farm parties, including consumer reporting agencies that provide us with information such as driving records, claim histories, and credit information






How We Use Information About You

We use customer information, sometimes including consumer report information, to do things such as:

Underwrite and rate your policies and accounts
Process your claims
Protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions
Provide proper billing
Service your policies and accounts
Enhance your customer experience
Offer you other insurance and financial services products that may suit your needs






How We Share Information

We share information about you, including information about our transactions with you (such as payments) and experiences with you (such as an auto claim), within our State Farm family of companies and with State Farm agents to help meet your current product and service needs. We share information about you with persons or organizations inside or outside our family of companies for our everyday business purposes, for public policy purposes, and as permitted or required by law. We may share information in connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, transfer, or exchange of all or a portion of our business or operating unit. We share information about you with companies that perform marketing or other services for us or with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These agreements allow us to provide a broader selection of insurance and financial products to you.
We share information with consumer reporting agencies, for example, during the underwriting process. We share information with other entities, as needed, to handle your claim. For example, we might share name, address, and coverage information with an auto body shop to speed up repairs on auto damage claims. We also share information, as needed, with other entities to protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions.





To Limit the Sharing of Information Within the State Farm Family of Companies

We share information within our State Farm family of companies so, for example, we do not have to ask you for the same information again. If you prefer to limit sharing information such as your driving record, claim history with other companies, and credit information, call your State Farm agent or 800-865-6035.

If you are an existing customer and have already told us your information sharing preferences, no action is needed unless you want to change your preference.
Your choice will apply to joint policyholders or account holders on shared policies and accounts.
Your choice does not limit State Farm from sharing certain information about your transactions with us or your experiences with us for our everyday business purposes or for public policy purposes.
In addition, your choice does not limit State Farm from sharing information in the event of a transfer, between State Farm companies, of all or a portion of a line of business.

Residents of Vermont: State Farm will not share personally identifiable information across our State Farm family of companies unless authorized by you. This does not limit State Farm from sharing certain information about your transactions with us (such as your payment history) or your experience with us (such as your claim history) as permitted by law.
