<p>
	TheStreet, Inc. (&quot;TheStreet&quot;) shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our Privacy Policy regarding the information we collect on TheStreet Portfolio of Websites as such term is defined in the <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/static/about/terms-of-use.html" target="_top"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a>. Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If changed, we will post an updated Privacy Policy on this page for your review.</p>
<p>
	Questions or comments regarding this policy should be directed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@thestreet.com"><strong>privacy@thestreet.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Information Gathered and Tracked by TheStreet</strong></p>
<p>
	We gather two types of data about our users: personal information and tracking information.</p>
<p>
	<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>
	Personal information is provided by users when registering on TheStreet Portfolio of Websites as a member of TheStreet, our free flagship site, or another one of our free websites, when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and voluntarily at certain other points, such as entering contests, completing surveys or through any marketing flows. You may enter your information on our site, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:members@TheStreet.com"><strong>members@thestreet.com</strong></a>, or by telephone at (866) 321-TSCM (8726), between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Registering for Membership on TheStreet</strong></p>
<p>
	Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on TheStreet.com. However, if you would like to use certain features, such as email newsletters, or access additional products of TheStreet Portfolio of Websites, we require you to&nbsp;<a href="https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?PID=PRFR-0003&amp;OID=000842"><strong>register</strong></a>&nbsp;to become a member.</p>
<p>
	In order to register, you will have to supply us with your email address and choose a unique User Name and Password. You will be required to verify your email address by clicking on the activation link in the Welcome Letter that will be sent to you upon your submission of a completed registration form.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Subscribing to Premium Services</strong></p>
<p>
	If you would like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based services, you will need to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or paid subscription. This may include credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on our servers.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Other Personal Information Collection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
		Portfolio Tool - We may provide a free portfolio tool which registered members of TheStreet can use to stay current on stocks in their portfolio. Participant&#39;s portfolio information is kept confidential.</li>
<li>
		White Papers - We may offer white papers on various investment and financial topics. In order to download these special reports, you may be required to enter your email address, phone number and/or some additional personal information.</li>
<li>
		Blogs - We may offer blogs featuring running commentary throughout the trading day by some of our most popular contributors. These blogs allow subscribers to respond to a blogger&#39;s commentary or to another subscriber&#39;s post. Access to some blogs may require a paid subscription to one of our premium services. We urge and encourage participants posting comments on the blogs to include their full name in any comment and to disclose any positions held in securities they discuss in any comment. Please note that information submitted to the blogs will be available for any user of that service to read, and is no longer private.</li>
<li>
		Surveys/Polls - At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reaction to a particular article. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally or by third-party partners to better market our services, participation is voluntary. In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers. Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.</li>
<li>
		Contests and Sweepstakes - We may offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants&#39; identities and notifying the winners. If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered or sponsored by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>TRACKING INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>
	Tracking information is automatically collected about all visitors to TheStreet Portfolio of Websites. This information consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using &quot;cookies.&quot; A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user&#39;s login name, that is written to the user&#39;s hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. Certain websites within TheStreet Portfolio of Websites are operated by third parties, such third party sites may use cookies or other tracking technology at such sites&#39;s discretion.</p>
<p>
	We use cookies in several ways to track user behavior. Cookies store visitors&#39; preferences and past activity on our site and other websites in order to provide better service to our visitors. The information we gather on an individual basis is used for advertising and internal purposes, such as accessing a member&#39;s account information. We also use tracking information on an aggregate basis, to track the readership of stories and usage of our products, to analyze traffic patterns on our sites, and to provide anonymous reporting of usage for internal and external clients. In all cases, cookies used by TheStreet are encoded and contain a unique digital signature to prevent tampering. They do not contain user passwords. We also employ technology that is commonly referred to as &quot;action tags&quot; (also known as &quot;web beacons,&quot; &quot;scripts&quot; or &quot;one pixel .gif files&quot;) to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.</p>
<p>
	We use Google Analytics remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on our websites. This allows us to provide targeted advertising in the future. If you do not wish to receive this tyupe of advertising from us in the future you can opt out using the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb#display_optout">Google opt-out page</a> or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p>
	In addition to the cookies described above, TheStreet, its agents, advertisers and third-party advertising vendors that serve ads onto our web sites, and other third party partners may use their own or third-party cookies or other tracking technologies for advertising, including delivering targeted advertisements and marketing messages based upon the websites you visit, or other purposes. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third part advertisers and vendors. Additionally, third party advertising vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the Internet. If you would like more information about cookies and targeted advertisements or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide such advertisements, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" title="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.</p>
<p>
	If you are accessing TheStreet Portfolio of Websites, you can control your browser&#39;s settings regarding cookies by selecting &quot;Internet Options&quot; or &quot;Preferences&quot; in the menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to easily navigate our web sites without having to constantly log in using your User Name and Password, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you are accessing TheStreet Portfolio of Websites through an alternative method, such as a mobile application or third-party content distribution service, you understand that you may not have the ability to disable cookies, depending on the specific access method.</p>
