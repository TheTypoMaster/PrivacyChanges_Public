</li>
<li>POSTING USER GENERATED CONTENT ON THE SITE; REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
<p>You have the ability to interact with the Site and other users by posting comments, engaging in project discussions, participating in the forums, uploading photos, and a variety of other ways (all such submissions or postings collectively referred to as "User Generated Content"). By submitting or posting any User Generated Content on the Site, you warrant and represent that:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>you own all rights in your User Generated Content and the performance contained in your User Generated Content or, alternatively, you have acquired all necessary rights in your User Generated Content to enable you to grant to eHow the rights in your User Generated Content described herein and for us to exercise the rights with respect to such User Generated Content that you grant herein;</li>

<li>you will make such permissions available to eHow upon request;</li>
<li>your User Generated Content is not defamatory in nature, does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy, rights to publicity or any other legal or moral rights of any third party.</li>
<li>if you are a direct competitor of an author or another Posting user, or otherwise have an interest adverse to the author or another posting user, you will fully disclose the interest;</li>
<li>you will not stalk, threaten or harass authors or other users or infringe upon, invade or attempt to infringe upon or invade their privacy; and </li>
<li>you will not Post any information or material which may constitute or encourage conduct that is a criminal offense, tort, or civil wrong or otherwise violates any applicable law. </li>
</ol></p>
<p>You agree to keep all records necessary to establish that your User Generated Content does not violate any of the foregoing representations and warranties and to make such records available upon the reasonable request of eHow. You acknowledge that the Site does not have any "digital rights management" or other security technology features to restrict someone who receives Content from copying and redistributing it.</p>
<p>To post User Generated Content on the Site, you must first complete the Site registration process to login (your "Account"). You agree to provide accurate current and complete information during the registration process, when contributing User Generated Content or when otherwise using the Site. You also agree that you will review, maintain, correct and update such information in a timely manner to maintain its accuracy and completeness. You agree to safeguard your user name and password, and you authorize us to accept any use of the Site through your Account as being used by you or someone authorized to act for you. You agree to be liable for any User Generated Content posted using your Account and for any transactions associated with your Account. You agree that we can rely upon the contact and other information that is supplied to us using your Account and that we will rely upon such information.

You may not share your password with anyone unless you are a minor, in which case you may share your password with your parents or other legal guardians.</p>
<p>When you submit ideas, suggestions, or proposals (collectively, "Ideas") to us, you represent, warrant, and agree that: (i) your Ideas do not include confidential or proprietary information, you have all necessary rights to submit them to us and that they do not and will not infringe or violate any third party rights of any kind; (ii) if we so choose, we may use and disclose your Ideas in any way; and (iii) we have no obligation to pay or reimburse you for your Ideas or our use of your Ideas. You also acknowledge that (x) we may have already created, or be in the process of creating, content that may be substantially similar to your Ideas or work samples at the time you submit those ideas or samples to us, and (y) elements of your Ideas and work samples may not be subject to protection under copyright law.</p>
</li>
<li>OWNERSHIP OF RIGHTS FOR USER GENERATED CONTENT; LICENSE RIGHTS
<p>You retain ownership of your copyrights and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in any User Generated Content you post to the Site, subject to the non-exclusive rights that you grant to us as described in these Terms. These Terms do not prevent you from granting similar rights to others.</p>
<p>Subject to your right to terminate your license to us as described below in this Section 5, you hereby grant eHow a worldwide, royalty-free, freely transferable, freely sublicensable (through unlimited levels of sublicense), non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and display (including in each case by means of a digital audio transmission), and create derivative works of the User Generated Content, in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. You also hereby waive any moral rights you may have in such User Generated Content under the laws of any jurisdiction. You hereby appoint us as your agent with full power to enter into and execute any document and/or do any act we may consider appropriate to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers set forth in these Terms. You agree that we may (but are not obligated to) display your User Generated Content, and your user name or your actual name (according to the preferences you select at the time that you register) along with your User Generated Content.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the posting of your User Generated Content for any period of time is sufficient consideration for the license granted herein to eHow.</p>
<p>You may choose from time to time to remove or modify User Generated Content that you previously posted on the Site if doing so would not interfere with other users' ability to enjoy the Site. For example, a request to remove your comments or posts from a long string of interactive posts could render the entire thread unintelligible and eliminate the ability of the other users of the Site to read and enjoy that thread. In these situations, we may anonymize your User Generated Content so that the threaded conversation remains intact. Your removal of any of your User Generated Content will automatically terminate our license to such User Generated Content. But if prior to such removal or modification, eHow has created, or developed specific plans to create, any electronic or printed materials containing such User Generated Content (e.g., in advertising, promotion or otherwise), then you agree that eHow may continue to exploit materials containing such User Generated Content after you have removed or modified that User Generated Content. However, six (6) months after you have removed or modified that User Generated Content, you may send us written notice to cease displaying such materials, in which event we will use commercially reasonable efforts to cease displaying such materials within thirty (30) days of our receipt of such notice. Your written notice to use must be sent to 1655 26th St., Santa Monica, CA 90404, Attn: Copyright Agent, or to copyright@demandmedia.com, and contain the following information:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>your name, address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
<li>the user name for your Account; </li>

<li>identification of the materials containing the User Generated Content in question, including the title and the URL where it may be viewed;</li>
<li>identification of the approximate date on which you removed or modified the User Generated Content contained in such materials;</li>
<li>a statement that you would like eHow to cease using such materials containing such User Generated Content; and</li>
<li>your certification that you own or have the exclusive rights to such User Generated Content.</li>
</ol></p>
</li>
<li>PROHIBITED CONTENT
<p>You agree not to post or submit to the Site any content or any other materials whatsoever that is or could appear to be:</p>

<li>infringing or alleged to be infringing upon a third party's rights, including any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other proprietary rights of any party, including, without limitation, any content that is the subject of any third party claim of infringement;</li>
<li>of a type that you do not have a right to transmit under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships, such as inside information and proprietary and confidential information;</li>
