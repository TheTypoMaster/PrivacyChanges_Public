Privacy Policy

PetSmart wants you to know how we collect, use, share and protect information about you online and in our stores. By interacting with us, you consent to our use of information that is collected or submitted as we describe in our privacy policy. We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we urge you to review it periodically.

California Disclosures

WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED
Types of personal information we collect include:

Your name
Your mailing address
Your e-mail address
Your phone (or mobile) number
Your credit/debit card number
Your purchase/return/exchange information
Your wish list information
Your date of birth or age
Your location
Your pet’s information (name, breed, date of birth, gender, veterinary information, photographs, etc.)

If you choose not to provide personal information, we may not be able to provide you with requested products, services or information.
Automated Information Collection
We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a PetSmart customer. If we are able to identify you as a PetSmart customer, we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in one of our stores. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in-store, mobile, etc.
PetSmart Automated Information Collection
We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device. This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of device you are using, purchase information and checkout process, search terms and geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. These technologies also enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits and SMS/text messages you have chosen to receive. We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention and other purposes.
In order to provide the best customer experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are shopping our website, performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.
Third-Party Automated Information Collection
In certain instances, we allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website and to use that information to serve ads for PetSmart products and services or for the products and services of other companies when you visit our website or other websites. These companies use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about products and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.
Our Mobile App and Mobile Website
Our PetSmart mobile app is downloadable onto smart phones and serves as a mechanism to take you to our mobile website. Our mobile applications do not currently collect personally identifiable information. Our mobile website collects the same type of information outlined throughout this policy.
PetPerks® Loyalty Program – Automatic Number Assignment
Beginning in 2014, PetSmart may automatically assign a PetPerks number to customers for whom we have other identifying information, such as a phone number or email address. This enables our customers to take advantage of our many promotions throughout the store and will allow us to better customize our offers.
User Experience Information
In order to improve your online shopping experience, help with fraud identification, and to assist our customer service representatives in resolving issues you may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g. information entered during checkout process), and browser information.
Social Media Widgets
petsmart.com includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, YouTube and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
Information from Other Sources
We may collect data that’s publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g. a blog, chat room, or social media) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.
We also obtain information provided by third parties. For instance, we obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing customer information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our customers (for example, adding address information). This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you.
In-Store Cameras
We use in-store cameras for security purposes and for operational purposes such as measuring and observing customer traffic patterns.
Geo-Location Tracking
Certain mobile devices contain geo-location tracking capability. We may use such capability or other geo-location tracking technology to generally identify your location in our store or your close proximity to it for marketing, to generate coupons and other offers, for analytical purposes and to prompt our associates as to which customers may need help.
HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION USED
Examples of how we use the information we collect include (but are not limited to):
Product and Service Fulfillment

Fulfill and manage purchases, orders, payments, returns/exchanges, or requests for information about our products and services in our stores, website, or mobile website, or to otherwise serve you.
Connect with PetSmart regarding customer service via our customer service center, or on social media platforms.
Provide services such as Wish Lists.
Administer sweepstakes and contests.
Notify you of any products you have purchased that are subject to recall or withdrawal.

Our Marketing Purposes

Deliver promotional offers, coupons, mobile coupons, in-store receipt messages, e-mails, mobile messages, and social media notifications.
Provide interactive features of the website or mobile applications, such as product reviews or marketing communications and other information regarding products, services and promotions.
Administer promotions, surveys, and focus groups.
Automatically assign a PetPerks® loyalty card number to you.
Use a review you submit for commercial purposes to promote the products or services in your review. We may also include the user name and city/state you gave when submitting your review.

Internal Operations

Improve the effectiveness of our website, stores, associates, mobile experience, and marketing efforts.
Conduct research and analysis.
Perform other business activities as needed, or as described elsewhere in this privacy policy.

Photographs and Information About Your Pet
We may take photographs of your pet and send them to you or your designated family members/agents via email or text to let you know, for example, that your pet is ready for pick up (e.g. in the salon), that your pet is doing well (e.g. during a stay in the hotel) or to commemorate that s/he has learned a new trick (e.g. in training class). We may also use the photographs on social media. Unless you ask the store associate who took your information not to do so, your email and phone number will automatically be entered into our customer database and may be used for operational and marketing purposes as provided for in this policy. Your pet’s photograph(s) may also be uploaded into the database and associated with your name.
Fraud Prevention
To prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft and otherwise protect our customers and our business
Legal Compliance
Investigate claims, incidents or inquiries regarding customers, associates, vendors and pets, assist law enforcement, animal control, health officials and/other government entities to respond to legal, regulatory, health and similar inquiries
HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION SHARED

We also share information with companies that are closely associated with PetSmart, such as Banfield Pet Hospital (Medical Management International, Inc.), PetSmart Charities, Inc., and PetSmart Charities Canada. These entities may use this information to offer you products, services and charitable opportunities that may be of interest to you.
Service Providers
We may share the information we collect with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, e-mail marketers, mobile marketing, analytics providers, web hosting providers, call center service providers, sweepstakes vendors, payment processors, coupon delivery vendors, or data enhancement providers) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions.

Elsewhere at Your Direction
At your direction or request, we may share your information. For example, if you create a wish list and elect to make it available to the public, your information will be accessible on our website, mobile or social applications, or in our stores.
Sharing with Other Companies (for their marketing purposes)
We may communicate to you information or special offers from other companies or organizations. In such cases, we do not provide your personal information to them and they will not know your identity unless you choose to transact with them, in which case their privacy policies will govern your relationship. With your consent, we may share your personal information with other companies, or organizations that are not part of PetSmart. These companies and organizations may use the information we share to provide special offers and opportunities to you.
Sharing Aggregate Information with Third Parties
We may share aggregate non-personally identifiable information (information that does not directly identify an individual) with third parties for any lawful purpose.

If some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, we may transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers. We also may retain a copy of that customer information.

If you provide us with personal information, PetSmart and other third parties may track your personal information as described in this privacy policy, including your movements on our website, mobile applications and social networks or in our stores. Such tracking allows us and third party providers to ease and customize your shopping experience. Neither PetSmart nor its third party providers have a systematic method for ensuring “Do Not Track” functionality in certain browsers can operate to prevent such tracking.

HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTED
Security Methods
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. However, no e-commerce solution, website, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.
E-mail Security
"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through e-mail.
Children’s Personal Information
We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.
Questions or Concerns
If you have general questions or concerns about how we use your personal information, please contact us at:
