Thank you for inquiring about the Best Buy Privacy Policy
The Best Buy Privacy Hub is a resource for our customers. You can view our Privacy Policy and learn more about our privacy practices and how you can control your personal information. Plus, you'll find links to third parties that provide information on how to protect your identity online.

We collect information related to your interactions with our websites and apps to create a superior, personalized shopping experience, whether you are online or in our stores. This information includes your IP address, browsing behavior while on our website, browser and device characteristics, and referring URLs. This information is collected and stored using a variety of common technologies, including various types of cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, and tags. 
Learn more about managing cookies, Flash cookies, and other automated online information collection. These technologies may also allow us to identify you as a particular Best Buy retail store customer when you visit our websites, and to link your activities on our websites to your interactions with us in our stores.
Our websites and mobile applications are not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers.
To help us understand and enhance our interactions with you, we may permit web analytics and other providers to collect and process information on our websites using the technologies described above. We also may share personal information with those providers. We may have similar arrangements with interest-based advertisers. Interest-based advertising is covered in more detail below.
Location Information
Some of our websites and mobile applications may collect certain information such as the type of mobile device you're using or your specific location to help you search for one of our stores. To allow any application to identify your location, you must enable this functionality through your mobile device's settings to allow the use of technologies such as Wi-Fi, GPS signals, cell tower position, or other technologies. Best Buy has no control over your device's settings.
Store Cameras
Our stores may use cameras for asset protection and other operational purposes, such as measuring traffic patterns and protecting and improving our business. 
Public Forums 
Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. 
How We Use the Information We Collect
We use the information we collect for things like:

Data Retention
We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
How We Share the Information We Collect
Best Buy does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties.
Best Buy Co., Inc. is the parent company of the Best Buy Companies ("Best Buy"), and as such, if you provide information to any of the businesses, stores or websites owned or operated by Best Buy, this information may be combined or shared among current or future Best Buy Co., Inc. entities, including affiliates and subsidiaries and will be governed by each of their privacy policies, as applicable. 
We may share your information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as:

Sending Best Buy marketing communications
Fulfilling subscription services

Sometimes we may be required to share personal information in response to a regulation, court order or subpoena. We may also share information when we believe it's necessary to comply with the law. We may also share information to respond to a government request or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Best Buy, our customers, or others; to prevent harm or loss; or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
We may also share personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution or similar event. You will be notified via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on our applicable website(s) of any change in ownership, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
We may share personal information in connection with financial products or services related to our business such as private label credit cards. We may also share personal information in connection with co-branded product or service offerings. For example, when you apply for a Best Buy credit card, we may share your personal information with our banking partners that issue the card.
How We Protect the Information We Collect
Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control and appropriately limit access to it. Best Buy cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. The Best Buy websites use encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL protects information you submit via our websites such as ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number. Information you provide to us via our in-store kiosk does not traverse the public Internet.
Your Choices Regarding the Information We Collect
You may choose to:

Stop receiving marketing or promotional e-mails, direct mail, phone and mobile marketing communications
Update and correct your personal information
Deactivate your account
Request removal of content or personal information posted by you from our website, online service, online application, mobile application, blog, or community forum. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your content or personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Please note: Even if we are able to anonymize or make your content or information no longer visible, this does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your content or personal information from the Internet as third parties may retain screen shots of Best Buy web pages (e.g., cache files).

To do any of these, let us know by one of these methods:

Follow the directions in a marketing e-mail or direct mail or mobile communication that you receive from us
Call 1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289) with your request and current contact information
