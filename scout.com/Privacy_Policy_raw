<br /> <b>UNITED STATES ONLY </b><br /> <br /> The Scout Services are hosted in the United States. All matters relating to the Scout Services are governed by the laws of the State of New York.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to, stored and processed in the United States. United States data protection and other relevant laws and regulations may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
<p><br /> <b>THE TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT SCOUT COLLECTS ONLINE</b><br /> <br /> <b>Information Provided By You<br /> <br /> </b>Scout receives personal information you voluntarily provide to us through the Scout Services. For instance, when you enroll in a club; enter a sweepstakes or contest; complete a survey; make a purchase; request information, services, or products; or register for any portion of our services, you may provide us information such as but not limited to your name, e-mail address, mailing address, or phone number.  You may also elect to provide us with demographic type information such as your age or gender. <br /> <br /> Users of forums and message/bulletin boards should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) and content on a forum, message/bulletin board, in a chat area, or other interactive area where information can be posted, the information can be collected and used by other parties. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to the security of information you voluntarily post in forums, chat rooms, message/bulletin boards, and other interactive areas. Please refer to the Terms of Service for additional terms regarding use of these services. <br /> <br /> <b>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE </b><br /> <br /> When you visit or use the Scout Services, Scout may collect non-personally identifiable information ("non-PII") about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to a Scout website, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Scout Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.  Other non-PII that may be collected includes click-stream information such as the address (or "URL") of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site.</p>
<p> </p>

<li>perform other business purposes as well as for purpose disclosed at the time of collection.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<li>To assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, all information collected from or in relation to you in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, bankruptcy proceeding, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of Scout or its affiliated entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except as provided herein and so long as you activate your membership, Scout will not sell to any third party your e-mail address unless you provide your informed consent.  <br /> <br /> <b>DIGITAL ADVERTISING &amp; COOKIES</b></p>
<p>Scout may work with third parties that support Scout Services by serving advertisements or providing Scout Services, such as allowing users to share content, view premium content, or post to the forums or tracking aggregate website usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect information. Scout does not control these technologies used by third parties.  The privacy policies of these third parties govern their use of such technologies.</p>
<p>Scout may also work with third-party companies to display ads on Scout Services and elsewhere on the Internet. These companies may use cookies (a small text file), pixels, or other technologies used to gather information about your visits to Scout Services as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies use this information to provide you more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising. Some of these companies may be participants in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). The DAA offers a choice mechanism with respect to certain types of data collection and use.

Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through Scout Services.<br /> <br /> <b>SEND-TO-A-FRIEND TOOLS</b><br /> <br /> Scout Services, from time to time, may include a send-to-a-friend application or social sharing tools that makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from the Scout Services to friends or family by e-mail or via a social network.

Those transactions may take place via a Scout Service, or the site of the third party. In any case, personal information you provide in connection with the transaction may be shared with the third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such opportunities and features.</p>
