Privacy Policy
Effective Date: This Privacy Policy was last revised on March 21, 2014 
Introduction and Overview
You have arrived at a web site that is provided by Pier 1 Imports (“Pier 1 Imports” or “we,” “our” or “us”).  This “Privacy Policy” governs your use of www.pier1.com and any other official Pier 1 Imports sites (including mobile sites or apps), and any interactive features, applications, and/or other services that we make available through a site that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, referred to as the “Site”).  This Privacy Policy also applies to Personal Information (defined below) we may collect from you in our Pier 1 Imports retail stores (“Store” or “Stores”), and through official surveys and sweepstakes entry forms, or in any other instance when you contact us.
This Privacy Policy describes what information Pier 1 Imports collects about you, why we collect it, how we use it, and under what circumstances we share it with third parties.  This Privacy Policy also describes the choices you can make about how we use your information.  To the extent we provide you notice on our Site or in our Stores of different or additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.
In addition, please review the Site’s Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Site.  By using our Site, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

Information You Provide to Us
We may ask you to provide us: (1) your first and last name, email address, home address, phone number, driver’s license number, credit and debit card numbers, checking account numbers, date of birth and social security number (when applying for or requesting services related to the Pier 1 Rewards Card) or other information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (hereinafter “Personal Information”); and/or (2) demographic information, such as information like your zip code (“Demographic Information”).  We may collect this information from you such as when you:

Submit account registration forms;
Sign up or request to be placed on our mailing, SMS text and/or email marketing lists;
Place an order through the Site;
Sign up for our Pier 1 Rewards Card;
Participate in a survey or Promotion (defined in Section 3(e) below);
Contact us regarding a question or concern;
Submit an application for employment; and
Otherwise interact with the Site or the Store.

Your decision to provide this information is voluntary, but if you choose not to provide this requested information you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Site’s features or our services.


Information We Collect When You Use the Site
In addition to information that you choose to submit to us, we and/or our service providers may automatically collect and/or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Site (“Usage Information”).  This Usage Information may be stored and/or accessed from your personal computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our Site.  Usage Information may include:

your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”);
your Device browser, operating system and mobile network information;
the areas within our Site that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
your general location; and
certain other Device data, including the time of day you visit our Site, among other information.

We may use various methods and technologies to collect and/or store Usage Information, such as:

Cookies.  A cookie is a file placed on a Device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information on your Device.  Our Site may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies and other types of cookie technology to store information on local storage. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some (but not all) instances can be blocked by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options.  Please note that these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies, visit www.adobe.com.  Please understand that if you disable or remove any type of cookie, some parts of our Site may not function properly.
Web Beacons.  A Web Beacon is a small tag (which may be invisible to you) that may be placed on our Site’s pages and messages.  Web beacons may be used by us for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.  The embedded script does not collect your Personal Information.
ETag, or entity tag.  An Etag or entity tag is a feature of the cache in browsers.  It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.

We may use the above technologies (or ones we incorporate in the future) for a variety of purposes, including:

Prevention of fraudulent activity and improved security functionality.
To assess the performance of the Site.
To offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Site, including identifying you when you sign in to our Site or keeping track of your specified preferences.
To deliver content relevant to your interests on our Site and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements and/or content. 



Location-Based Information
Our Site (including our mobile apps) may use location-based services to verify your location, deliver you relevant content and/or advertising based on your location, as well as to share your location with our service providers as part of the location-based services we offer.  Further, we or our service providers may use your location information to display our nearest Store location to you.  You have the ability to turn location-based services on and off by adjusting the settings of your Internet browser or mobile device, or by following the standard uninstall process and removing all Pier 1 Imports applications from your mobile device.


Information We Collect From Third Parties
We may also receive information about you from your friends and other third parties, and combine or link that information with information we have about you.  To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with your Personal Information, the combined information, unless disclosed otherwise, will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.  In no other circumstances will this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.


Information We Collect When You Interact with Third-Party Sites  
The Site may allow certain kinds of interactions between the Site and your account on a third-party site or application.  The use of this functionality may involve the third-party site providing information, including Personal Information, to us.  For example, when you register with the Site, you may have an option to use your Facebook account to facilitate the registration or transaction process on the Site.  If you choose to use this functionality, the third-party site may send Personal Information about you to us.  If so, we will treat this information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.  In addition, we may provide links on the Site to facilitate sending a communication from the Site.  For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, Tweets or Facebook postings.  These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.  You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such tools.


Information You Provide About a Third Party  
You may send someone else a communication from the Site, such as sending an invitation to a friend.  If so, the information you provide (names, email addresses, mobile number, etc.) will be used to facilitate the communication and will not be used for marketing purposes unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Site, your email address, mobile number, name or username and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).  Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies.

We may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information or Usage Information for various purposes, including, but not limited to, the following:

Improving the effectiveness of our Site, marketing endeavors and service offerings;
Processing credit applications;
Site registration;
Processing and completing purchase, return and similar transactions;

Providing mobile marketing messages and service messages;
For internal business purposes; and
For purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.



Sharing of Information with Third Parties
We may share your Personal Information, Demographic Information or Usage Information with third parties under various circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: 


When You Request We Share With Third Parties. 
We may share information with third parties at your request.  In the event we do so, all information we disclose will be subject to the privacy policies and practices of such third parties.  In addition, the third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when you interact with their technologies, content or apps on our Site or link to them from our Site.  This may include using third-party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third-party posting or content sharing tools.  We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third-party privacy policies prior to interacting with them.


Third Parties Providing Services to Pier 1 Imports.  
We may use third party service providers to perform certain services, such as: (a) to assist us in e-commerce operations; (b) to manage a database of customer information; (c) hosting the Site; (d) designing and/or operating the Site’s features; (e) tracking the Site’s activities and analytics; (f) enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services; (g) to allow you to participate in live chat on the Site; and (h) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential.  We may provide third parties with access to your information to carry out the services they are performing for us.   Third-party analytics and other service providers such as Google Analytics may set and access their own technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you.  These service providers use the technology described above to help us analyze how users use the Site. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them.  However, some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices.  For example, to learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please click here.  To learn about opting out of the use of Adobe cookies for analytics and on-site personalization, please click here.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third partie’ opt-out options.


To Protect the Rights of Pier 1 Imports and our Users.  
We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Pier 1 Imports or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Policy, our Terms of Use, and other applicable agreements and policies); or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or court orders).


Affiliates and Business Transfer. 
We may share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates.  We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site and/or our Stores; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including during the course of any due diligence process.


Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.  
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) through the Site, in the Stores or through one of our social media pages that may require registration.  By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and likeness in advertising associated with the Promotion.  If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winner’s list.


Co-Branded Areas.  
Certain areas of the Site may be provided to you in association with third parties (“Co-Branded Areas”) such as co-promotional partners and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them.  Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party and indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and use of your information.  If you elect to register for products and/or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party.  Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Site, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area.  An example of a Co-Branded Area is the Pier 1 Rewards Card.  We are not responsible for such third party’s data collection or practices and you should look to such third party privacy policies for more information.
