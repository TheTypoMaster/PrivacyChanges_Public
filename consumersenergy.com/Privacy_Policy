Children's Guidelines 
The Consumers Energy website has an area designed specifically for children called “Brain Station.” This area of the website contains information designed for children that is both educational and interesting. We do not knowingly solicit personal identifying information from children. There are links to online computer games intended to help children learn electrical and natural gas safety. Players have the option to provide their names when playing the game and if they decide to provide it, are instructed only enter their first name. If a name is provided, it is used strictly to personalize responses and is removed after the game is completed or exited.Back to top
