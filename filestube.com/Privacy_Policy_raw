        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h2>Log files, IP and Information About Your Computer</h2>
        <p>
        Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the website we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you are going when you leave the website. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, e-mail patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the website. The linkage between your IP address and your personal data is not shared with third parties without your prior consent or except when allowed or required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
        The Provider takes the privacy of Users very seriously. Thus, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personal data with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal data except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.
        </p>
        <p>We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the use of the website to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate.
        </p>

        <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
        The Provider cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation a court action), to protect the property and rights of the Provider or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclosures to Others</h2>
        <p>
        The Provider may also disclose your personal data and other information you provide, to another third party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of the Provider's division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal data and other information that you provide to us.
        </p>

        <h2>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>
        We may share aggregated information that does not include personal data and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data to third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>International Transfer</h2>
        <p>
        Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers and servers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your consent to such transfer.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessing and Changing Your Information</h2>
        <p>
        You can review the information you provided us with and make any desired changes to them at any time. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, the Provider may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us using the following e-mail address: <a href="mailto:support@FilesTube.to">support@FilesTube.to</a> or <a href="mailto:support@FilesTube.com">support@FilesTube.com</a> (as applicable).
        </p>

        <h2>Your Obligations</h2>
        <p>
        You have certain obligations imposed by applicable law and regulations:

        <ol>
        <li>
            You must, at all times, respect the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights which may belong to third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must not download, upload or otherwise disseminate any information which may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic.
        </li>
        </ol>
        Any violation of these obligations may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your use of the website and/or service by the Provider, as we take these principles seriously and consider them to be the basis on which Users adhere to the website and the service which it offers.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
        We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable laws related to security breach notification) to you via conspicuous posting on the website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with: (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement; or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>
        The Provider may retain your personal data and other information as long as they are required for purposes they were collected. The Provider will retain personal data consistent with applicable legal requirements. Generally, at a minimum, the Provider will retain personal data collected from you in its active, internal company databases for five years, at which point it will migrate them to its offline archival systems, where the Provider will retain them for a period of one year (together, the "Retention Period"). After the Retention Period, if no longer required the Provider will purge personal data from its systems. In the event of an investigation by law enforcement or a response to claims or legal process, the Provider may retain personal data until such investigation or process is completed, which may be longer than the Retention Period.
        </p>

        <h2>Statement</h2>
        <p>
