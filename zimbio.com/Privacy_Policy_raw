			<h2 class="head">Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>Last Updated: September 9, 2013</p>
<h1><span style="color: #888888;">Summary</span></h1>
<p><strong>We take the privacy of our users very seriously.</strong> Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at <a title="privacy@livingly.com" href="mailto:privacy@zimbio.com">privacy@livingly.com</a> or in writing at: Privacy Director, Livingly Media, Inc., 990 Industrial Road, Suite 204, San Carlos, CA 94070.</p>
<p><strong>Online Privacy Standards.</strong> While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at <a title="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/toc.htm" href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/toc.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/toc.htm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What This Policy Covers.</strong> This policy covers Livingly Media&#8217;s treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or use our services. We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify you as a member in our system, such as your selected UserID, is not considered personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>What This Policy Does Not Cover.</strong> This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners and advertisers. In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate independently of Livingly and they have their own privacy or security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #999999;">How we collect information</span></h1>
<h2>Information You Provide</h2>
<p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> During the registration process, we collect your email address. We will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of this address. You will also choose a UserID that we will use to identify you in our system.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Member Profile Information.</strong> You can choose to provide us with additional optional information about yourself, to help us deliver a more personalized experience to you. You can also choose to provide us with information you use to access web services of our partners, such as your username or password for certain instant messaging and photo-sharing services. We use this information to enable easy access to your favorite services throughout our website.</p>
<p><strong>Access To Your Personal Information.</strong> In general, we make it easy for you to view the personally identifiable information we have collected from you in your member profile page, where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see fit.</p>
<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Children.</strong> As explained further in our Terms of Service, currently available at <a href="http://www.livinglymedia.com/terms-of-service/" target="_blank">http://www.livinglymedia.com/terms-of-service/</a>, you must be 13 years of age or older to register to use our website. Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about children. If you believe that we have information from or about anyone under 13 years of age, please notify us by email at <a title="privacy@livingly.com" href="mailto:privacy@livingly.com">privacy@livingly.com</a> or write to our Privacy Director at the address noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Social Security Number.</strong> We do not ask for or require your social security number to use any of our services or to access any part of our site.</p>
<h2>Information We Track</h2>
<p><strong>Log Files.</strong> Similar to many websites, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal information automatically and store it in web server log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users&#8217; movements around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or members from which individual member identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user&#8217;s computer for record-keeping purposes. It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, and what pages they view during their visit. Similar to many websites, we store an encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you when you come back to our website without requiring you to log-in every time. Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on our site.</p>
<p><strong>Our partners.</strong> Some of our business partners may also use cookies on our site. For example, some of our advertising partners may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We have no access to or control over these cookies, and, as noted above, this privacy policy does not govern the use of cookies by our business partners or advertisers. To be excluded from these services, please visit some of our partners’ websites and follow the instructions provided.</p>

<h1><span style="color: #999999;">How we use information</span></h1>
<h2>In Company Communications</h2>
<p>We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our websites as our primary means to inform our members of important service and promotional announcements.</p>
<p><strong>Service-related Announcements.</strong> We use your email address to deliver important service-related announcements. Example service-related announcements include: email verification during registration, requests for password reset, important security or server maintenance updates, software updates, upgrades, and new releases, or policy changes. These service-related announcements are considered a fundamental part of our web service, and members cannot opt-out of these email announcements.</p>
<p><strong>Promotional Announcements.</strong> In order to improve the experience for our users, we will offer you the ability to sign up for optional email communications, such as regular updates from our corporate website, or email alerts and newsletters for specific web guides. These communications are enhancements to our service and are entirely optional. We will ask for your consent before sending you promotional communications, and will make it easy for you to unsubscribe from these communications, either through the emails or though your member profile page.</p>
<p><strong>Refer A Friend Program.</strong> If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend&#8217;s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a title="privacy@livingly.com" href="mailto:privacy@livingly.com">privacy@livingly.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h2>On Our Website</h2>
<p><strong>Identification Of Authors By UserID.</strong> We are a collaborative media company, which means we depend on the contributions and actions of our members to improve the quality of the site experience. When you make a contribution to a wikizine (such as adding a picture or posting an article), you will be identified by your UserID as the author of that contribution. Similarly, when you take other important actions on the website, such as editing or deleting someone else&#8217;s content or message, you will be identified as the author of that action. In these circumstances, we will only identify you by your UserID. In some cases you can choose to include other personally identifiable information along with your UserID citations, such as your instant messaging username. However, in using our service, you are not required to provide or publicize any personally identifiable information in connection with your contributions and actions on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Public Profile.</strong> When you register, we will create a public member profile based on your UserID. You have the option to include your personally identifiable information in your public profile, but you are not required to do so. You can easily add, edit, and delete information in your public profile through the member profile page.</p>
<p>Site Statistics. As noted above, we use information collected from our web log files to calculate and publish anonymous, non-personal, aggregate statistics that we believe our members are interested in viewing. For example, we track and publish the total number of users who have viewed a particular web page. We publish this data in aggregate form only, and do not tie it to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2>For Internal Reporting and Analysis</h2>
<p>As noted above, we use information gathered from log files and cookies to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users&#8217; movements around the site, and to gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #999999;">How we share and disclose information</span></h1>

We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you submit or permit others to submit through public messages.</p>
<h2>With Third-Parties</h2>
<p><strong>Sharing, Renting, and Selling Information We Collect.</strong> We will neither rent nor sell your personally identifiable information to anyone. Occasionally we share anonymous, non-personal, aggregate information about our user base with partners or advertisers, and we may publish these aggregate usage statistics on our website for the interest of our members. We do not tie this shared or published data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Linked Services.</strong> In some cases, we allow you to access or link to other web services through our website. For example, we allow users to import photos from a gallery hosted on a partner&#8217;s site and we allow users to enter an instant messaging chat room hosted by a partner. We make it easy for you to determine when you are accessing or linking to these other web services through or website. In all of these cases, our partners may choose to collect your personal information as they deem appropriate. As noted above, we are not responsible for or in control of how our partners collect, use, or disclose your information obtained through these linked services. We encourage you to be aware when you are using these partner services and, for your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.</p>

At that time, your user information may become subject to the acquiring company&#8217;s privacy policy.

Please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p><strong>Management Procedures.</strong> We also maintain standard physical and electronic procedural safeguards that limit access to your personally identifiable information to our employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who, through the course of standard business activities, need to access your personally identifiable information.</p>
