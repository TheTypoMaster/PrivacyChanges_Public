                        provide.
                    
When you send a gift or virtual gift card to a
                        person, we collect information such as that
                        person’s name, telephone number email, and/or shipping
                        address.
                    
When you ask us a question or request a
                        catalog, we collect your name, email address,

In a purchase at a co-branded designer
                        boutique within a section of a Saks Fifth
                        Avenue store (these boutiques are leased by the third
                        party designer), we and the boutique collect information

From Saks’ interactions with you: We collect
                    information about you and your transactions and other
                    interactions with us, including the products or services you
                    purchase, use and return.
From Third Party Sources: We may combine
                    your information with information we collect or receive
                    about you from other online and offline sources, which helps
                    us to customize our services.
Personalized Site Visits: We, or our service
                    providers, may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, log
                    files, and other technologies to collect information about
                    visitors to our website, use of our online services, and
                    interactions with our emails and online advertisements, such
                    as your browser type and operating system, viewed webpages,
                    links that are clicked, IP address, sites visited before
                    coming to our website, emails we send that you open,
                    forward, or click through to our website. Collecting this
                    information, and linking it with your personal information,
                    helps us to tailor our website and enhance your online
                    shopping experience by saving your preferences while you are
                    visiting a particular site, and to help identify site
                    features, promotions, advertisements, and offers that may be
                    of particular interest to you.
Personalized Third Party Advertisements: We
                    also may use third party advertisements placed by ad
                    networks to support our site. Some of these advertisers and
                    ad networks may use technology such as cookies and web
                    beacons/pixel tags when they advertise on our site, which
                    will also send these advertisers and ad networks information
                    including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to
                    visit our site, and whether you have Flash installed. Some
                    of these advertisers and ad networks also may use anonymous
                    data, such as demographic data, received from third parties
                    to assist in the delivery of advertisements to you. These
                    advertisers and ad networks use the information described
                    above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your
                    online behavior, search activities on our site and on other
                    third party sites, demographic information and/or relevant
                    to your general location, so that the advertising and offers
                    you see on our site more closely reflect your interests and
                    needs. For example, if you search for or browse a particular
                    designer or item on our site, you may see an advertisement
                    from a third party with information about, or an offer
                    similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on
                    our site, or an offer related to a third party whose site
                    you have visited in the past.
You can set your Internet browser settings to stop
                    accepting new cookies, to receive notice when you receive a
                    new cookie, to disable existing cookies, and to omit images
                    (which will disable pixel tags). Note that the opt-out will
                    apply only to the browser that you are using when you elect
                    to opt out of advertising cookies. You can learn more about
                    and opt out from receiving third party advertiser cookies by
                    visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page
                    here.
                    Without cookies or pixel tags though, you may not be able to
                    take full advantage of all of our website features.
                
Mobile Information: We offer mobile
                    applications ("apps") which allow you to shop online, check
                    product availability, learn about store events, or receive
                    other information from us. All personal information
                    collected via our mobile application is protected by this
                    Privacy Policy. We, or our service providers, may also
                    collect, use, or disclose personal information and
                    non-personal information from and about you on our mobile
                    websites and through your interactions with us on your
                    mobile device. This information may include a telephone
                    number and mobile device identifier provided by your mobile
                    device or wireless carrier, as applicable. You do not have
                    to provide your location information to use our mobile
                    applications however, store-specific services require a zip
                    code to function and we will save your zip code(s) for
                    future reference. When you download our mobile application,
                    you may choose to allow it to obtain your precise location.
                    In this case, we will determine your zip code from the
                    precise location data received from your mobile device. We
                    do not store precise location data; we only store the zip
                    code associated with the location. Our mobile applications
                    offer automatic (push) notifications. We will provide push
                    notifications only to those who opt-in to receive them. If
                    you have questions about location and notification privacy,
                    please contact your mobile service provider or the
                    manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your
                    settings. We may offer updated or enhanced versions of our
                    mobile applications that include additional features created
                    by us or using third party functionality. Our applications
                    or the third party may automatically collect information
                    about your precise location from your device, but only if
                    you allow it.

                    the right to share information with legal authorities and
                    other companies for fraud protection and credit risk

                    of our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another
                    entity acquires all or a part of a business within the Saks
                    family of affiliated companies, information we have
                    collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In

                    brought by or against a business within the Saks family of
                    companies, such information may be considered an asset of
                    the company and may be sold or transferred to third parties.
                    Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable
                    efforts to try to require that the transferee use personally
                    identifiable information provided through this website in a
                    manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

What about security?

Protecting the security of your information is very important
                    to us. When you transmit sensitive personal information
                    (such as credit card information) from your computer to our
                    servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall"
                    (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps
                    keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within
                    our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure
                    socket layer) encryption. For our mobile website, we protect
                    your payment card information using encryption technology
                    when you place an order. Once we receive your transmission,
                    we will take reasonable precautions to secure and protect
                    the information on our systems. Unfortunately, no data
                    transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure and,
                    accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of
                    any information you disclose or transmit to us online.
                    However, we strive to protect your information and
                    privacy.

How does Saks communicate changes to this Policy?

Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be noted on the home
                    page of this website with a link to the revised policy. Your
                    continued use of the Site following posting of changes to
                    these terms will mean you accept these changes. If we change
                    the policy in any material way, we will provide appropriate
                    notice to you.

What about other websites?

Our website may include links to third-party websites that
                    are not affiliated with Saks. These websites may send their
                    own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit your
                    information. The privacy policies of these other websites
                    may be very different from our policy. We are not
                    responsible for the privacy practices of these other
                    websites and cannot guarantee the security of any personal
                    information you provide to or collected by such third party
                    sites.

Whom do I contact if I have additional questions or concerns
                about this policy?
