            These Google Analytics Terms of Service (this <em>"Agreement"</em>) are entered into by
            Google Inc. ("Google") and the entity executing this Agreement (<em>"You"</em>). This
            Agreement governs Your use of the standard Google Analytics (the <em>"Service"</em>).
            BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USING THE
            SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND ARE
            AUTHORIZED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF, AND BIND TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT.
            In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:
          </p>
          <h2>
            1. Definitions.
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>"Account"</em> refers to the billing account for the Service. All Profiles linked
            to a single Property will have their Hits aggregated before determining the charge for
            the Service for that Property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Confidential Information"</em> includes any proprietary data and any other
            information disclosed by one party to the other in writing and marked "confidential" or
            disclosed orally and, within five business days, reduced to writing and marked
            "confidential". However, Confidential Information will not include any information that
            is or becomes known to the general public, which is already in the receiving party's
            possession prior to disclosure by a party or which is independently developed by the
            receiving party without the use of Confidential Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Customer Data" or “Google Analytics Data"</em> means the data you collect, process
            or store using the Service concerning the characteristics and activities of Visitors.

            Property for the purpose of collecting Customer Data, together with any fixes, updates
            and upgrades provided to You.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Hit"</em> means the base unit that the Google Analytics system processes. A Hit
            may be a call to the Google Analytics system by various libraries, including,
            Javascript (e.g., analytics.js), Silverlight, Flash, and Mobile. A Hit may currently be
            a page view, a transaction, item, or event, social interaction, or user timing. Hits
            may also be delivered to the Google Analytics system without using one of the various
            libraries by other Google Analytics-supported protocols and mechanisms the Service
            makes available to You.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Processing Software"</em> means the Google Analytics server-side software and any
            upgrades, which analyzes the Customer Data and generates the Reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Profile"</em> means the collection of settings that together determine the
            information to be included in, or excluded from, a particular Report. For example, a
            Profile could be established to view a small portion of a web site as a unique Report.
            There can be multiple Profiles established under a single Property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Property"</em> means any web page, app, or other property under Your control that
            sends data to Google Analytics. Each Property includes a default Profile that measures
            all pages within the Property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Privacy Policy"</em> means the privacy policy on a Property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Report"</em> means the resulting analysis shown at <a href=
            "//www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">www.google.com/analytics</a> for a
            Profile.

            <em>"Servers"</em> means the servers controlled by Google (or its wholly owned
            subsidiaries) on which the Processing Software and Customer Data are stored.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Software"</em> means the GATC and the Processing Software.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Third Party"</em> means any third party (i) to which You provide access to Your
            Account or (i) for which You use the Service to collect information on the third
            party's behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Visitors"</em> means visitors to Your Properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The words <em>"include"</em> and <em>"including"</em> mean "including but not limited
            to."
          </p>

            million Hits per month per account. Google may change its fees and payment policies for
            the Service from time to time including the addition of costs for geographic data, the
            importing of cost data from search engines, or other fees charged to Google or its
            wholly-owned subsidiaries by third party vendors for the inclusion of data in the
            Service reports. The changes to the fees or payment policies are effective upon Your
            acceptance of those changes which will be posted at <a href=
            "//www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">www.google.com/analytics</a>. Unless
            otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. Any outstanding balance becomes
            immediately due and payable upon termination of this Agreement and any collection
            expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google will be included in the amount
            owed, and may be charged to the credit card or other billing mechanism associated with
            Your AdWords account.
          </p>

            revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to install, copy and use the GATC
            solely as necessary for You to use the Service on Your Properties or Third Party's
            Properties; and (b) You may remotely access, view and download Your Reports stored at

            or to the Software, the Documentation or the Service; (iv) remove any proprietary
            notices or labels on the Software or placed by the Service; (v) use, post, transmit or
            introduce any device, software or routine which interferes or attempts to interfere
            with the operation of the Service or the Software; or (vi) use data labeled as
            belonging to a third party in the Service for purposes other than generating, viewing,

          <p>
            Neither party will use or disclose the other party's Confidential Information without
            the other's prior written consent except for the purpose of performing its obligations
            under this Agreement or if required by law, regulation or court order; in which case,
            the party being compelled to disclose Confidential Information will give the other
            party as much notice as is reasonably practicable prior to disclosing the Confidential
            Information.

            Google and its wholly owned subsidiaries may retain and use, subject to the terms of
            its privacy policy (located at <a href="//www.google.com/privacy.html" target=
            "_blank">www.google.com/privacy.html</a>), information collected in Your use of the
            Service. Google will not share Your Customer Data or any Third Party's Customer Data
            with any third parties unless Google (i) has Your consent for any Customer Data or any
            Third Party's consent for the Third Party's Customer Data; (ii) concludes that it is
            required by law or has a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of
            Customer Data is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of
            Google, its users or the public; or (iii) provides Customer Data in certain limited
            circumstances to third parties to carry out tasks on Google's behalf (e.g., billing or
            data storage) with strict restrictions that prevent the data from being used or shared
            except as directed by Google. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that
            oblige those parties to process Customer Data only on Google's instructions and in
            compliance with this Agreement and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
          </p>
          <h2>
            7. Privacy.
          </h2>
          <p>
            You will not (and will not allow any third party to) use the Service to track, collect
            or upload any data that personally identifies an individual (such as a name, email
            address or billing information), or other data which can be reasonably linked to such
            information by Google. You will have and abide by an appropriate Privacy Policy and
            will comply with all applicable laws, policies, and regulations relating to the
            collection of information from Visitors. You must post a Privacy Policy and that
            Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies that are used to collect
            data. You must disclose the use of Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes
            data. This can be done by displaying a prominent link to the site “How Google uses data
            when you use our partners' sites or apps”, (located at <a href=
            "//www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target=
            "_blank">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>, or any other URL Google may
            provide from time to time). You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
            a Visitor is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to,
            the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the Visitor’s device where
            such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such
            information and obtaining such consent is required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must not circumvent any privacy features (e.g., an opt-out) that are part of the
            Service.

            You may participate in an integrated version of Google Analytics and certain
            DoubleClick and Google advertising services (<em>"Google Analytics Advertising

            will cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. Google

            Agreement, (b) Google may share with the Third Party any Customer Data that is specific
            to the Third Party's Properties, and (c) You will not disclose Third Party's Customer
            Data to any other party without the Third Party's consent.

          <h2>
            16. Miscellaneous, Applicable Law and Venue.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Google will be excused from performance in this Agreement to the extent that
            performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable
            control. This Agreement (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties in writing)
            represents the complete agreement between You and Google concerning its subject matter,
            and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If any
            provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision
            will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent
            permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this
            Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed by
            and construed under the laws of the state of California without reference to its
            conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules,
            and regulations, and California law, rules, and regulations, California law, rules and
            regulations will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and
            personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The
            United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the
            Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement. The
            Software is controlled by U.S. Export Regulations, and it may be not be exported to or
            used by embargoed countries or individuals. Any notices to Google must be sent to:
            Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, with a copy to
            Legal Department, via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed
            given upon receipt. A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default.
            You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of Your rights in this Agreement without
            Google's prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. The relationship between
            Google and You is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of
            independent contractors. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
            of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The following sections
            of this Agreement will survive any termination thereof: 1, 4, 5, 6 (except the last two
            sentences), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16.
