Subscriber and such third parties shall retain all right and title (including, without limitation, all proprietary rights), to the extent of their respective interests, in and to the Subscriber IP. IBM shall have no right to copy, transfer, sell, disclose, license, alter, or otherwise use the Subscriber IP for any purpose, except pursuant to the terms set forth herein in connection with the Hosting Services.</p>


<p><b>Scheduled Maintenance </b></p>

	<p>IBM will schedule maintenance to the Hosting Platform during non-peak usage hours. Any scheduled maintenance that may result in the Hosting Services being unavailable will be notified to Subscriber's technical contact no less than 1 business day before the commencement of the maintenance unless maintenance is being conducted due to an emergency.</p>

<p><b>Emergency Maintenance </b></p>

	<p>IBM may temporarily limit or suspend the availability of all or part of the Hosting Platform if it is necessary for reasons of public safety, security, maintenance of the Hosting Services, interoperability of services, data protection, or to perform work that is necessary for operational or technical reasons. If emergency maintenance is required as defined in this Section then IBM will notify Subscriber's technical contact immediately upon commencement of the maintenance.</p>

<h2>Customer Support </h2>

			<table border="1" cellpadding="0"> 
			<tbody>

				<p>Customer receives standard support which includes best available support during IBM's standard business hours. </p>

			</tbody>
			</table>

	<p>Subscriber has the option, but not the obligation, to upgrade its standard customer support plan ("Support Services") to Gold Support, which shall be billed as set forth in the applicable Order Form. </p>

<h2>Confidential Information</h2>

	<p>For purposes of these Terms of Service, Confidential Information shall mean any confidential or other proprietary information that is disclosed by or on behalf of a Party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other Party (the "Receiving Party"), whether disclosed orally or in writing, whether disclosed before or after the Effective Date, and whether or not marked or otherwise designated as confidential, including, without limitation, the Subscriber Data, the Hosting Platform, information relating to the Disclosing Party's customers, potential customers, suppliers, financial and business information, technological information, specifications, business and product plans, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, and any other non-public information disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information which: (i) is or becomes public knowledge without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party; (ii) is publicly disclosed by the Receiving Party with the prior, written approval of the Disclosing Party; (iii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or access to Confidential Information; or (iv) is intentionally disclosed by the Disclosing Party to a third party without restriction on disclosure. Each Party agrees: (i) not to disclose, or permit any third party or entity access to, the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information (or any portion thereof) without prior written permission of the Disclosing Party; (ii) not to utilize, except as permitted under these Terms of Service or as required to perform any obligations under these Terms of Service, the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information (or any portion thereof); (iii) to ensure that its employees shall only be given access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to the extent necessary for such employees to perform their duties under these Terms of Service; and (iv) to ensure that any of its employees who receive access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information are advised of the confidential and proprietary nature thereof and are prohibited from copying, utilizing or disclosing such Confidential Information, except as required to perform any obligations under these Terms of Service. In the event the Receiving Party becomes or may become legally compelled to disclose any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other process or otherwise), the Receiving Party shall provide to the Disclosing Party prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of these Terms of Service. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall use its reasonable efforts to insure that confidential treatment shall be afforded such disclosed portion of the Confidential Information.</p>

<h2>Data Protection</h2>

<p>The Hosting Services comply with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks. If required by law, the parties or their relevant affiliates will enter into separate standard unmodified EU Model Clause agreements in their respective roles pursuant to EC Decision 2010/87/EU with the optional clauses removed. All disputes or liability arising under EU Model Clause agreements, even if entered into by affiliates, will be treated by the parties as if the dispute or liability arose under the terms of this Agreement. If you make personal data available to the Hosting Platform, as between you and IBM, you are considered the sole controller of the personal data and you appoint IBM as a processor to process (as those terms are defined in EU Directive 95/46/EC) such personal data. You will not use the Hosting Platform or the Hosting Services in conjunction with personal data to the extent that doing so would violate applicable data protection laws or any regulations requiring security measures beyond those specified for the Hosting Platform. IBM will only process such personal data to the extent required to make the Hosting Platform available in accordance with this Agreement and you agree that any such processing is in accordance with your instructions. This Agreement describes the applicable security functions and features, including technical and organizational security measures, which IBM will implement. By using the Hosting Platform or Hosting Services, you accept that the security measures are appropriate for the personal data being processed. You agree that IBM may use subcontractors worldwide, including other IBM companies, to provide the Hosting Platform or Hosting Services. IBM shall reasonably cooperate with you in its fulfilment of any legal requirement, including providing you with access to the personal data. You agree that IBM may process the Subscriber Data, including any personal data, across country borders to IBM in the United States. If IBM changes the way it processes or secures personal data and such change causes you to be noncompliant with applicable data protection laws, you may terminate the affected Hosting Platform or Hosting Service within 30 days of IBM's notification of the change.</p>
