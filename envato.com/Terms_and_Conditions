Welcome to Envato Market
1.
  Hi, we’re Envato and welcome!
  We’re happy to have you here and we hope you enjoy your stay.
  When we say ‘we’,
  ‘us’ or
  ‘Envato’ it’s because that’s
  who we are and we own and run the Envato Market sites.

2.
  Envato’s ecosystem of digital marketplaces helps millions of people
  around the world get creative and earn online. When you create an account
  and accept these terms you become a member of our
  community. You will have an Envato Market account that
  will allow you to buy and sell items like the ones found
  on the Envato Market sites and make other related transactions.

3.
  The Envato Market sites are platforms that allow members to buy and sell
  licenses to use digital items like website themes, production music,
  motion graphics project files, software code, vectors, images and much,
  much more. Envato Market facilitates transactions between us, buyers and
  authors via a payment method. Any transactions are
  logged on your member’s statement, which records the payments
  made by you to authors via Envato (as a buyer)
  and by buyers via Envato to you (as an author).

4.
  The items on Envato Market are owned by the authors, not by us. We
  provide a platform; we do not take ownership of the items or get any
  rights to use the items other than to make them available on and promote
  our sites.

5.
  During your time with us you agree to follow the ground rules outlined in
  these terms so please read and understand them. If you don’t accept
  the terms then we’ll be sad, but you will need to leave because
  your presence on and use of the Envato Market sites is conditional on your
  acceptance to be bound by these terms and the
  Privacy Policy whether you become a member
  or not.

How browsing and membership works
6.
  Browsing: You need to be 13 years or over to browse the
  Envato Market sites. We don’t knowingly collect any information from
  anyone aged 13 or under. When browsing the sites you agree to
  follow our guidelines or instructions and keep in mind that these terms
  apply to any use of our sites whether or not you’re a
  member.

Membership
7.
  Age: You need to be 18 years or over to become a member.
  If you’re under 18 you will need to be under the supervision of a
  parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age, and this adult
  will be responsible for all your activities.

8.
  Benefits: Membership is free. When you become a member
  you get an Envato Market account that is accessible from any of our
  Envato Market sites (and is also your Envato account for other Envato services).
  Your membership will allow you to ‘buy’ (license) items from
  authors, participate in our online forums, and generally contribute to
  our ecosystem of sites that help people get creative. Membership also
  gives you the opportunity to become an author
  (see section 28 – Becoming an Author)
  and earn referral income
  (see section 10 – Referrals).

9.
  Your responsibility: You promise that information you
  give us is true, accurate and complete and that you will keep your
  account information up-to-date (including a working email address). Your
  membership is not transferrable. You are responsible for any use of the
  Envato Market sites that occurs in conjunction with your username and password
  so keep your password secure and don’t let any other person use
  your username or password on your behalf. If you realise there’s
  any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security you need
  to let us know immediately.

  It is important that you understand your responsibilities as a member of
  our community so please take the time to review this section and the
  Envato Market Terms carefully.

10.
  Referrals: As a part of our Affiliate Program, if you
  refer a new member to any of our Envato Market sites you will be eligible to
  receive affiliate income. You can find out more about the Affiliate
  Program and the terms applying to referrals here.

How buying items works

  This section will help you understand what you are buying when you
  purchase an item and how that transaction takes place on Envato Market.

11.
  The total price for an item on Envato Market is made up of
  several components including:



Item price: When you ‘buy’ an item,
      you’re paying a price to the author for the right to use that item;
      you’re not actually buying the item itself. What you get includes a
      license directly from the author to use that item. Items are subject to
      specific terms of use, and these terms are the ‘license’ that
      we set on Envato Market. Different license types are available for you
      to choose when you have selected an item. You’ll need to think about
      the way you want to use the item so that you can pick the right license to
      allow that use. It’s your responsibility to choose the correct
      license for your requirements.

      
        For the different types of licenses and what they mean see our
        licensing page.
        This links to our licensing resources, and if you still have a licensing
        question you can open a
        support ticket.
      


Buyer services fee: When you ‘buy’ an item you’re
      also paying a fee for the services you get from Envato like 24/7 buyer
      support, fraud protection, item quality control and other related buyers
      services.
      
        You can read more about the awesome buyer services buyers get from us over
        at Why Buy From Us information page.
      

        The list price is made up of the: a. item price and b. buyer
        services fee, and is the price you see on an item page.
      


Handling fee: In some transactions on Envato Market the
      total price may include a handling fee. See section 16 below for details about the handling fee.
  

Taxes: Some transactions on Envato Market may be subject
      to tax that may be added to the list price or handling fee. See
      section 20
      for details about taxes on Envato Market.
  

Transacting as a buyer:
12.
  You can make payments in one of two ways: you can ‘buy it now’
  or you can buy Envato credits via your Envato Market account.

13.
  Envato credits: When you deposit money into your
  Envato Market account it is converted by your financial institution from
  your currency to US Dollars. We then convert those US Dollars to Envato
  credits. Envato credits are the virtual currency on Envato Market and
  one (1) Envato Credit is equal to one (1) US Dollar.

14.
  Envato credits can only be used to pay for Envato Market transactions. We do
  not generally refund any monies deposited to your Envato Market account to buy
  Envato credits (but you may have rights under an applicable consumer law,
  which we don’t exclude).

15.
  If you choose to buy using Envato credits, the total price will be
  deducted from your Envato credits.

16.
  If you choose to buy using a method that is not Envato credits you will
  be redirected to a payment method provider (a ‘payment
    agent’), and you may be required to pay a handling fee
  charged over the item price.

17.
  Currency conversion costs: You are responsible for all
  costs of currency conversion relating to your Envato Market account. Your
  financial institution does the currency conversion and may charge you
  additional fees (we don’t control either the conversion rates or
  your financial institution’s fees).


  This means that you may incur additional costs when purchasing
  from Envato Market, which we have no control over.

18.
  Terms of buying: When you buy an Envato Market item
  you’re doing so on the following terms:



      you promise to us and the author that you have carefully considered the
      suitability of your chosen license, and that you have chosen
      appropriately;
  

      you cannot cancel a completed purchase of an item;
  

      we and the authors do not promise that any particular item will continue
      to be available on Envato Market so you should download and save the item
      as soon as you buy it;
  

      once you purchase an item and you pay the item price, you acquire a non-
      exclusive license to use the item under the terms set out in the license
      (non-exclusive means others might also license the same item);
  

      the author retains ownership of the item;
  

      your relevant details may be provided to the author of the item in order to
      facilitate the transaction, for example for invoicing and item support
      services;
  

      we have the right to enforce against you the terms of the license that
      you have acquired from an author.
  


  It is important that you understand the terms on which you are making a
  purchase. Please take the time to review this section carefully.

19.
  What authors promise you about items: The author of an
  item you buy promises you that:



      they own or have rights to use the intellectual property rights in that
      item and that item does not infringe the intellectual property rights
      of a third party;
  

      the item is not false, inaccurate, misleading, fraudulent, unlawful or
      defamatory;
  

      the item does not violate any applicable law or regulation (including
      those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair
      competition, criminal law, pornography, anti-discrimination, trade
      practices or fair trading);
  

      the item does not contain viruses or other computer codes, files or
      programs which are designed to limit or destroy the functionality of
      other computer software or hardware.
  


  This is what authors are promising you when you buy an item.

20.
  Taxes:



     Prices and fees are inclusive of transactional taxes where relevant (like
     sales tax, VAT and GST), except for the following (which will be added as
     part of the total price buyers see before finalising a purchase): (a) European
     Union VAT (if applicable) and (b) any other transactional taxes we state on
     the site will be added.
  

      You are responsible for paying all other fees and taxes associated with your use
      of Envato Market wherever levied (including withholding tax, if
      applicable). We may collect geographical location information to determine
      your location, which may be used for tax purposes (so location information
      you give us must be accurate for tax residency purposes).
  

21.
  Envato credits expire: Envato credits expire if not used
  within 12 months from the date of deposit, and will be forfeited on the
  12 month anniversary of the deposit date. If you deposit money to your
  Envato Market account at any time during that 12 month period before your
  Envato credits expire, the total balance of your Envato credits (that is,
  both the new deposit and the balance of any unused older Envato credits)
  will become available for a further 12 months from the date of the new
  deposit. If you don’t use your Envato credits within that further
  12 months, the credits will be forfeited on the 12 month anniversary of
  the new deposit. We generally try to tell you beforehand when Envato
  credits are going to expire and be forfeited, but this is not always
  possible and we’re not obliged to warn you. Check your
  member’s statement regularly for details of expiry dates. If you
  have different rights under an applicable consumer law, we don’t
  exclude them.


  If you haven’t used your Envato credits within 12 months they may
  expire.

22.
  Items with an incorrect price or incorrect information: Despite our
  reasonable efforts, items may occasionally be listed at an incorrect price
  or with incorrect information. If this happens, we may cancel or reverse a
  transaction, even after it is completed and a payment has been processed. If
  we do this, we’ll promptly arrange for any payment to be credited or
  refunded and you must not use the item.

Refunds
23.
  Given the nature of downloadable digital items, we do not generally offer
  a refund or credit on a purchase unless required under Australian
  consumer law or other relevant consumer protection laws. If you would
  like to request a refund or credit on a purchase, you should open a support ticket.

24.
  We will assess refund or credit requests on their merits, considering the
  digital nature of Envato Market items and the type of item preview that was
  available before purchase. There is no obligation to provide a refund or
  credit in situations like the following:



      you have changed your mind about an item;
  

      you bought an item by mistake;
  

      you do not have sufficient expertise to use the item;
  

      you ask for goodwill; or
  

      you can no longer access the item because it has been removed by its
      author from Envato Market (we advise you to download items as soon as you
      buy them to avoid this situation).
  

25.
  If we decide to issue a refund or credit, this will be done using the same
  manner used to make the purchase. So if the item was bought using Envato
  credits, you will be given credit in Envato credits; if the item was bought
  using a particular payment method you will be refunded using the same
  payment method in reverse. Any payment made to you (not Envato credits) will
  be made in US Dollars, under the rules of the payment method (see
  section 17 - Currency conversion costs
  about currency conversion back to your local currency).


  It is important that you understand how refunds work on Envato Market.

26.
  Disputes lodged with payment agents: If, as a buyer, you
  lodge a dispute with a payment agent, this will result in a freezing of
  your Envato Market account until the dispute raised with the payment agent
  has been closed. This makes it very complex to resolve any related
  issues, and means we cannot make payments or issue refunds out of your
  Envato Market account, so we encourage buyers to contact us directly first
  to see if we can help resolve any concerns.


  27.
  Fine print: We are not a bank or licensed deposit taker in
  Australia or elsewhere, your credits are not deposits under Australian law
  about banks, and that means you don’t get the benefit of any deposit
  insurance or guarantee under those laws. We don’t act as a fiduciary or
  as a trustee for you, and we’re not a licensed financial service
  provider.

Becoming an author
28.
  Imagine creating what you want, when you want, from the comfort of your
  own home, making passive income whether you’re working or not. Some
  of our authors sell stock items in their free time as a hobby, some do it
  to get their name out there, and some are able to make it their full time
  profession. If you want to get involved in our community as an author
  find out how here. Remember
  that if you become an author these terms will continue to apply, along
  with the Author Terms you’ll sign up to as an author.

  To find out more about how to become an Author visit the
  ‘Become an Author’
  guide
  here.

Intellectual Property
29.
  What we own: We own all the Envato
  content that we have put on Envato Market (unless otherwise
  stated and excluding content owned by others). This includes the design,
  compilation, and look and feel of the Envato Market sites, and copyright,
  trademarks, designs and other intellectual property on Envato Market.
  We own all the trademarks, logos, service marks and trade names on Envato Market
  (unless otherwise stated and excluding these things owned by
  others). You will not copy, distribute, modify or make derivative works
  of any of our Envato Content or use any of our intellectual property in
  any way not expressly stated in these terms.

30.
  What we don’t own: We do not own the items on Envato Market;
  our authors do. So we cannot take responsibility for the
  quality, safety or legality of the items. We do not warrant that the
  items or any member content, code, data or materials available on or via the
  Envato Market do not infringe the intellectual property rights of a
  third party. (Each author provides warranties to you directly when you
  purchase their item – see
  section 19 - What authors promise you about items.)

31.
  Copyright, trademark and intellectual property claims:
  We respect the intellectual property rights of others and we require that
  authors do the same. If you believe that an item or member content
  infringes an intellectual property right (including copyright) please see
  the information in our
  Content
    Policy.


  Our Content Policy is where you will find all the information relating to
  how we treat intellectual property on Envato Market including
  copyright and other rights.

Our use of your information
32.
  Privacy: We respect your privacy. When you become a member you will be
  asked to provide some information about yourself. This information may be
  used by us and contractors in connection with providing the Envato Market sites and
  their services, including marketing activities.

  Our Privacy Policy explains how we deal
  with your information and it forms part of these terms.

33.
  Confidential Information: We value your information and
  take reasonable precautions to protect it. While we take reasonable steps
  to preserve the security of your information, please be aware that we
  can’t promise that your use of the Envato Market will be
  confidential, and we can’t promise that any information you provide
  to us is perfectly secure. While using the Envato Market, you may also
  become aware of confidential information about us or another member. You
  promise to not disclose any confidential information made available to
  you through the Envato Market to any other person.

Playing fair
34.
  Prohibited Conduct: Envato is founded on the idea of
  community and like any functioning and healthy community, some things are
  not allowed and will not be tolerated. We aim to take a common sense
  approach to the general code of conduct on Envato Market but you
  promise that you will not:


      use a false email address, impersonate others, or misrepresent your
      affiliation with others;
  

      attempt to gain unauthorised access to computer systems or content
      through the Envato Market;
  

      attempt to contact other members through the Envato Market or use any
      information gained from the Envato Market with the intention to make a
      private arrangement that would otherwise be made using the Envato Market;
  

      enter any arrangements that are not consistent with these terms or the
      Author Terms;
  

      use information gathered from or through the Envato Market in a way that
      may confuse or mislead consumers (for example, automatically gathering
      information to set up a site that looks like one of our sites);
  

      attempt to or actually interrupt, negatively impact or alter the
      Envato Market operation in any way;
  

      use the Envato Market or any of the content in a way that violates
      applicable law, that violates the intellectual property or other rights of
      us or others, or that is fraudulent, obscene, unprofessional, offensive,
      misleading or defamatory;
  

      modify, reproduce, display, publish, distribute, copy, transmit, perform,
      license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell or re-sell any
      information, content, software, or item obtained from or through the Envato
      Market, other than in accordance with these terms or the license for
      the item.
  

35.
  We strongly recommend that you don’t make your contact details
  public on the Envato Market or in any communications via the Envato Market sites.
  Contact details include your email address, street address, Skype name
  and phone number (but not social network handles). If you do, it must not
  be for any reason prohibited under
   section 34(c) - Prohibited Conduct
  and you do so at your risk!

36.
  Content removal: We can look at or remove any of your
  content for any reason at our discretion. Reasons might include quality
  assurance, if we receive a valid copyright take-down notice, if we think
  that the use of your content is unauthorised, misleading, incorrect,
  offensive, or in breach of anyone else’s rights, or if we think
  that your use of the Envato Market and any content might result in
  liability to us or anyone else.

37.
  Community participation: We take great pride in our
  global and thriving community—it’s part of what makes the
  Envato Market such a friendly place. We focus on transparency and mutual
  respect and invite you to participate, give feedback and have your say.
  Before participating on Envato Market, please read the
   Community Guidelines, as
  you agree to follow them as part of these terms.

Linking; apps made by others
38.
  Linking to the Envato Market: We’d be delighted if
  you decide to link to Envato Market from other sites but you have to
  link to a full version of a page as seen by someone navigating directly
  to the Envato Market sites and looks the way we’ve intended and
  not link directly to an image hosted on Envato Market. That includes
  no “in-line” linking methods resulting in images hosted on Envato Market
  being displayed on other sites. You must not “frame” any Envato Market
  pages by surrounding those pages with someone else’s content, materials
  or branding. We reserve the right to insist that any link to the Envato Market
  be discontinued, and to revoke your ability to link to the Envato Market.

39.
  Links from the Envato Market: The Envato Market sites may
  contain links to other non-Envato sites. We have no control or
  responsibility over anything on those sites, and do not endorse or
  sponsor those sites, even if they are affiliated to us.

40.
  Third party developers: We welcome the contribution of
  our members and broader community, who offer applications that work with
  Envato Market. You will need to form your own view about these
  applications and their developers; we’re not able to warrant or
  endorse those applications and disclaim liability relating to these
  applications.

Legal Housekeeping
41.
  Eligibility, suspension or termination: Membership is not an
  automatic right, it is a benefit for community members who follow our
  reasonable rules and treat other community members well. We hope that you
  will be with us for a long time. But we do reserve the right, based on our
  reasonable discretion, to determine whether or not your use of Envato
  Market complies with these terms. We can suspend or terminate your
  Envato Market account at any time for any reason (acting reasonably of
  course), including if you don’t comply with these terms. If we do decide to
  permanently terminate your Envato Market account you must not apply for a new
  account as unfortunately you will no longer be welcome in our community.


Our indemnity to you
42.
    We provide Envato Market, not the items on Envato Market. We are
    liable and responsible for:


        our use of the Envato Market;
    

        the services, messages, Envato Content, software or other information we
        send through Envato Market;
    

        Envato Content breaching of any intellectual property rights belonging to
        others;
    

        our breach of these terms;
    

        our breach of any industry code, regulation or law that applies.
    

43.
    You have no responsibility to us for, and we agree to indemnify you
    from, all liabilities, costs, expenses (including legal fees) and loss
    arising from third party claims due to any of the matters set out in the
    previous
    section 42 – Our indemnity to you.
  
Your indemnity to us
44.
    You are liable and responsible for:
  


        your use of the Envato Market;
    

        the items, message, content, information, software or other materials you
        send through Envato Market;
    

        your content breaching any intellectual property rights belonging to
        others;
    

        your breach of these Envato Market Terms;
    

        your breach of any license of an item;
    

        your breach of any industry code, regulation or law that applies.
    

45.
    We have no responsibility to you or to any other person for all
    liabilities, costs, expenses (including legal fees) and loss arising from
    third party claims due to any of the matters set out in the previous
    section 44 – Your indemnity to us
    and you agree to indemnify us, our directors, officers, employees and agents
    from all losses.
  

    This means that you protect us from costs and claims that happen because
    of your actions on the site.
  
46.
    We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defence
    and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and
    in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defence of such claim.
  
47.
    Availability: We strive to have the Envato Market available
    to you 24 hours a day, seven days a week but you know how the internet
    works: occasionally you might not be able to access the Envato Market, and
    this might happen for any reason, at any time, with or without notice, or
    at our absolute discretion. We might also change aspects of how Envato Market
    works. We will not be liable to you for any loss you suffer as
    a result of these things.
  

48.
  Third party: If you’re agreeing to these terms on
  behalf of someone else (like your employer), then you’re promising
  to us that you have full legal authority to bind that third party.


49.
    Disclaimer:  In some places there may be consumer or fair
    trading laws that apply and that may give you rights that we cannot
    exclude, restrict or modify (‘non-excludable law’).  We do not exclude or
    modify any non-excludable law. Except as provided in a non-excludable law,
    we are bound only by the express promises made in these terms and we are
    not bound by implied terms. Except as provided in a non-excludable law, our
    and each author’s liability for breach of any implied warranty or condition
    which cannot be excluded is limited, at our or the author’s option, to
