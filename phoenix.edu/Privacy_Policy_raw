The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might differ from your jurisdiction. We require our Education Partners and Business Associates to use your Personal Information in accordance with this policy and to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected in accordance with applicable laws.

9. Do Not Track and Online Behavioral Advertising
Do Not Track (DNT) is a browser based signal that, when set, signifies your desire not to be tracked online. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other DNT mechanisms, University of Phoenix does not itself respond to web browser-based DNT signals.
We use a third-party assurance service to comply with a cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). As part of this service, our online advertisements and Sites taking part in Online Behavioral Advertising are delivered with an AdChoices icon that helps consumers understand how their data is being used and provides options to consumers who want more control. Some ads are targeted to your interests and preferences based on your browsing history, which is stored in a cookie on your computer. Your browsing history on the Site may be tracked in these cookies even if ads are not being displayed. By clicking on the AdChoices icon and following the instructions, you may adjust your privacy preferences. If you opt-out using AdChoices, our Sites that participate in the program will no longer collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for behavioral advertising purposes. For more information, or to opt out of this type of information collection, you may also visit http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/184?v=1.
10. Opt Out
Marketing Communications
If you do not wish to receive marketing email communications from us, you may express your choice where indicated on the applicable email or other communication or unsubscribe.
If you do not wish to receive marketing telephone calls or mailings, you may express your choice to opt-out by emailing the Office of Compliance.
If you do not wish to receive text messages you may opt out by texting STOP to cancel future text messages.  By sending STOP, you agree to one additional confirmation message stating that you've opted out and will no longer receive text messages from University of Phoenix. To get help, text HELP. You may also get additional support or help by sending an email toTextMsgSupport@phoenix.edu or by calling 866-766-0766.
Marketing opt-out requests will only remove you from our list and the list of any Business Associate performing services on our behalf. We are not responsible for the use any other party may make of the Information once it has been transferred in accordance with this Policy, and you will need to contact such entity to have your Information removed from its database.
Student Educational Records and Social Networking Content
Students who desire to prevent release of their directory and educational record Information in accordance with FERPA may place a FERPA Hold on their academic file. Click here to review your University's FERPA Policy.
You may change various user settings related to sharing your Personal Information contained in any user profile you set up as part of Social Network activities furnished by us, subject to contractual, academic, legal or technical restrictions and reasonable notice. Note that your withdrawal from Social Network activities might prevent us from providing you with certain products or services.
Other Collection, Use and Disclosure
In any situation not covered by the foregoing, you may be able to opt out of our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information subject to applicable contractual, academic, legal or technical restrictions and reasonable notice. Note that if you opt out of certain uses of your Personal Information, we may no longer be able to provide certain products or services. For more information on your ability to opt out, email the Office of Compliance.
11. Your California Privacy Rights
Under California’s Shine the Light law, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83, we provide California residents the ability to opt out of disclosures to Education Partners for direct marketing purposes. To opt out of these disclosures at no cost, email the Office of Compliance.
12. Our Security Measures
We will take commercially reasonable measures to secure and store your Information to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Information under our control. We utilize industry-standard security measures when accepting your credit card Information during the online ordering process, as well as whenever we ask you to log in to any of our Sites.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. As a result, although we will utilize such measures, we do not guarantee you against the loss, misuse or alteration of Information under our control, and you provide Information to us at your own risk. You should always take care how you handle and disclose your Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure email, Social Networks or other Internet channels.
13. Monitoring of Communications
We may monitor and retain all incoming and outgoing communications for training of our representatives and for quality assurance purposes. To the extent such communications are selected, they are only retained as long as necessary to adequately discharge these purposes, unless a specific communication needs to be retained for legal reasons.
14. Internet Technologies Used
Cookies, web beacons and other relevant Internet technologies are used in our emails and on our Sites to allow us to accomplish the uses set out above as well as to deliver Sites messaging and to keep track of your Information. These small pieces of program code reside in your computer and browser and can be removed. If you desire to remove such technologies you may do so, but this may render our Sites unusable to you. You can opt out of cookies or the other Internet technologies used by disabling these features in your browser program. Please note that the deletion of certain opt-out cookies may require you to renew your Online Behavioral Advertising opt outs periodically. Consult your browser's Help menu for assistance in changing cookie settings or removing cookie files.
15. Site Hosting and Links from Our Sites to Other Websites
Some of our Sites may contain links to websites hosted by Education Partners, Unrelated Entities and Business Associates operating websites on their own behalf or on behalf of multiple entities. Some of these websites may collect your Personal Information and may apply their own policies on how your Personal Information is used. In addition, some of our Sites may have Additional Policies that apply to the use of Personal Information collected on that Site. Please make sure to read the policies of any websites you visit on the Internet carefully. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any websites that are not operated by or exclusively for us, and the collection, use and disclosure of Information about you will be subject to the policies applicable on those websites.
16. Privacy Policy Changes
University of Phoenix may update this Privacy Policy or revise it from time to time. You should contact us as described below or check back at this Site periodically to obtain a current copy of this Privacy Policy. We urge you to review this Privacy Policy frequently to obtain the current version. Your continued provision of Personal Information or use of our services following any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes. If we intend to use Information that personally identifies you in a manner materially different from what we stated at the time it was collected, we will attempt to notify you at least 30 days in advance. You will be given a choice as to whether or not previously provided Information may be used in a new way.
