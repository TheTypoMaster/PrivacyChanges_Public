Wolfram Research Privacy Policy

		Wolfram Research understands your concerns about how personally identifying information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly.
		

		The information we obtain from site participants and visitors helps us enhance and refine our service and content. In addition to information that you provide to us voluntarily, we also receive information whenever you interact with our websites (such as your IP address, connection information, browser type, and so forth).
		

		Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to

		our users, or others.
