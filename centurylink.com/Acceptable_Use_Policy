Qwest's Acceptable Use Policy

Qwest has formulated this Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") in order to
encourage the responsible use of Qwest's networks, systems, services,
web sites and products (collectively, the "Qwest Network and Services")
by our customers and other users of the Qwest Network and Services
(collectively, "Users"), and to enable us to provide Users with secure,
reliable and productive services. By using the Qwest Network and
Services, Users consent to be bound by the terms of this AUP. Qwest
reserves the right to modify this AUP in its discretion at any time.
Such modifications will be effective when posted. Any use of the Qwest

of such modification.

Suspension; Termination. Any User which Qwest determines to have
violated any element of this AUP may be subject to a suspension or
termination of service.  Qwest will suspend service for violation of the

Qwest will attempt to notify Customer prior to suspending service for

placed on blacklists. Qwest may take such further action as Qwest
determines to be appropriate under the circumstances to eliminate or
preclude repeat violations, and Qwest shall not be liable for any
damages of any nature suffered by any Customer, User, or any third party
resulting in whole or in part from Qwest's exercise of its rights under
