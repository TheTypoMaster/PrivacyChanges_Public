        </div>

        <p>We collect information about you and your associated device(s) when you use our products or services or otherwise interact with us or with third-party services through our products and services. Examples of the types of information we collect include:</p>
        <strong>Personal Information</strong> 

        <p>"Personal Information" means information that we directly associate with a specific person or entity (for example, name; addresses; telephone numbers; email address; Social Security Number; call records; wireless device location). Personal information does not include "de-identified,&#148; "anonymous," or "aggregate" information &#150; which are not associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
        <strong>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)</strong> 

        <p>Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI", is a subset of Personal Information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number.</p>

        <p>For more information see <a href="/Company/PrivacyResources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_CPNI">Privacy Resources/Customer Proprietary Network Information</a></p>
        <strong>Credit and Financial Information</strong> 

        <p>We collect information about your credit card or banking information, Social Security Number, and credit history for account opening, management and billing and collection purposes. Financial information we collect is governed by <a href="http://s.tmocache.com/Cms/Files/Published/0000BDF20016F5DD010312E2BDE4AE9B/5657114502E70FF30124DE7B5D9A9D91/file/Financial%20Privacy%20Policy%20Feb%202012%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">T-Mobile&#146;s Financial Privacy Policy</a></p>
        <strong>Network and Device Information</strong> 

        <p>We may collect information about your use of our network (or other carriers&#146; networks when roaming domestically and internationally) and the device(s) associated with your account, network data related to WiFi usage and device, and performance information, as well as data relating to your use of our website, applications and other products and services.</p>

        <br />
         <strong>Location Data</strong> 

        <p>We may collect your device's location whenever it is turned on (subject to coverage limitations).</p>
        <strong>Performance and Diagnostic Data</strong> 

        <p>We may collect performance and diagnostic data about your use of our network, networks you roam on, WiFi services or your device. For example, we may collect information about the performance of the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, battery strength and other device or network performance issues. We may also collect information about applications on your device, the fact that an application has been added, when an application is launched or fails to launch, and length of time an application has been running.</p>
        <strong>Video Data</strong> 

        <p>When you use a T-Mobile video application, for example T-Mobile TV, on your device, we may collect information about the programs you watch to determine customer viewing habits so that we can tailor video selections to you or our customers.</p>
        <strong>Back Up and Cloud Services</strong> 

        <p>Some devices may automatically upload to T-Mobile network servers information you have stored on the device and/or SIM card in order to facilitate specific functions. For instance, some devices may back-up your address book, photo album, or diagnostic data. You may choose to disable such uploads, but this may affect functionality of the device or your services. We may also provide you the ability to upload other information from your device to T-Mobile or third-party network servers. For instance, you may have the option to upload pictures, text messages, recordings, calendars, tasks, or notes.</p>
        <strong>Collection of Information About Children</strong> 

        <p>We do not knowingly solicit children to purchase our services or products. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your account, any information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this Policy. If you are the primary account holder, you will have the ability to set the marketing preferences for any other lines on your account, including those for any children to whom you provide a device.</p>

        <p>Our websites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information on our websites from anyone under the age of 13. We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.</p>

        </div>

        <p>T-Mobile collects information about you in three primary ways:</p>
        <strong>Information You Provide</strong> 

        <p>We collect information that you provide to us when you apply for, purchase, or use our products or services, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
        For example, some of the ways you may provide information to us include: 

        <ul>
          <li>When you sign up for our voice or data services or purchase other products or services, we may collect personal contact, billing, and credit information.</li>

          <li>When you establish or modify an online account, we may collect user identification information, passwords, and/or security question responses that you will use for future sign-on.</li>

          <li>When you interact with our customer service representatives, enter information on our websites, submit survey responses, or pay for services, we may also collect Personal Information and other information. We may monitor and record phone calls, e-mails, live chats, or other communications between you, your device, and our customer service representatives or other employees or representatives.</li>

          <li>When you use our services on a phone provided to you by an account holder.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong> 

        <p>We automatically collect a variety of information associated with your use of your device (on our network, when roaming, or in WiFi mode) and our products and services, some of which may be associated with you or another user on your account.</p>

        <br />
         For example some of the ways we may automatically collect information include: 

        <ul>
          <li>Our systems capture details about the type and location of wireless device(s) you use, when the device is turned on, calls and text messages you send and receive (but we do not retain the content of those calls or messages after delivery), and other data services you use.</li>

          <li>We may also gather information about the performance of your device and our network. Some examples of the types of data collected include: the applications on the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, and other device or network performance issues.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</strong> 

            <p>We may use, or we may engage third-parties to use on our behalf, cookies (small data text files placed on your computer or device) or similar technologies to identify your computer or device and record your preferences and other data so that our websites can personalize your visit(s), see which areas and features of our websites are popular, and improve our websites and your experience.</p>

            <p>We may also use web beacons (small graphic images on a web page or an HTML e-mail) to monitor interaction with our websites or e-mails. Web beacons are generally invisible because they are very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page or e-mail message.</p>

            <p>Depending upon your device or computer, you may be able to set your browser(s) to reject cookies or delete cookies, but that may result in the loss of some functionality on our websites. If we combine or link cookie or web beacon information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined or linked information as Personal Information under this Policy.</p>
          </li>

          <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none"><br />
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Web Browsing Activity</strong> 

            <p><i>Our Websites.</i> When accessing our websites, mobile websites and related applications and widgets designed for your device or web-based experience, we automatically collect certain information about your device and your visit, such as your IP address, browser type, date and time, the web page you visited before visiting our website, your activities and purchases on our websites, and other analytical information associated with the sites.</p>

            <p><i>Other Websites.</i> When your device&#146;s web browser utilizes our data services to access websites other than our own, we automatically capture information associated with your browsing activities, and measure and monitor network and Internet connection performance, throughput, latency, and similar network data.</p>

            <p><i>Do Not Track Policy.</i> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites&#146; privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, we do not currently respond to the browser DNT signals when you use our services and products or interact with our websites or online services. We do allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for online interest based advertising purposes and to opt out of our interest-based advertising on your device, as described <a href="#choicesaboutadvertising">below</a> .</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Voice Controlled Applications</strong> 

            <p>If you use a voice-controlled application, that application may collect and record your requests and other information from you and your phone.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Information From Other Sources</strong> 

        <p>We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive credit information from third-party sources before initiating your service, or background information in connection with employment opportunities. We may also obtain updated address information from our shippers or other vendors. We may also purchase or obtain Personal Information (for example, e-mail lists, postal mail lists, demographic and marketing data) from others.</p>

        </div>

        <p>We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes, such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To route your calls or message or otherwise provide you with service;</li>

          <li>To provide and bill for products and services you purchase and charge to your account;</li>

          <li>To deliver and confirm products and services you obtain from us;</li>

          <li>To verify your identity and maintain a record of your transactions and interactions with us;</li>

          <li>To provide customer and technical services to you;</li>

          <li>To create, modify, improve, enhance, remove or fix our network, products and services, and their performance;</li>

          <li>To identify and suggest products or services that might interest you;</li>

          <li>To make internal business decisions about current and future product and service offerings;</li>

          <li>To protect our rights, interests, safety and property and that of our customers, service providers and other third parties; and</li>

          <li>To comply with law or as required for legal purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
         <strong>Fraud Prevention</strong> 

        <p>We may use Personal Information, including voice print recordings, account information (such as purchase patterns) and device information for investigations or prevention of fraud or network abuse.</p>
        <strong>Information Collected from Cookies</strong> 

        <p>We may also use information collected from cookies or other similar technologies to improve our websites, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request.</p>
        <strong>Marketing</strong> 

        <p>We may use information we collect to contact you about T-Mobile or third-party products, services, and offers that we believe you may find of interest. We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or other methods. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time as outlined below in <a href="#infochoices">Choices Regarding Use of Your Information</a>.</p>
        <strong>Directories</strong> 

        <p>We do not publish directories of our customers&#146; wireless numbers; nor will we provide or make such numbers available to third-parties for listing in their public directories, without the customer&#146;s prior consent.</p>
        <strong>Performance, Diagnostics &amp; Management</strong> 

        <p>We collect information about devices, our network and WiFi usage to perform diagnostic analyses and understand how your device is performing overall. Diagnostic data helps us troubleshoot technical issues related to your device&#146;s performance such as battery life, dropped calls, processing speed, device memory, service coverage, and network and WiFi signal strength that you and other customers may experience. If you are using a device in WiFi mode, we may collect information about that usage, such as the routing address and IP address. We also may use diagnostic data to identify and recommend products and services.</p>
        <strong>Location-Based Services</strong> 

        <p>We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your general location. We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm.</p>

        <p>Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance, Find My Device, or search results, etc.). These data services, known as Location-Based Services ("LBS") are made available by us and others, usually via applications. These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources.</p>

        <p>These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite ("GPS"), Assisted GPS ("AGPS"), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user&#146;s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance, or search results, etc.)</p>

        <p>LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data. Where we allow third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our network, we require those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this policy.</p>

        <p>It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided &#150; whether by us or another entity.</p>

        <p>You should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of third-parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people.</p>

        <p>Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent. You will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared (except in the case of certain parental controls or similar services associated with enterprise or multi-line accounts &#150; for example, T-Mobile&#146;s FamilyWhereTM services &#150; which may be managed solely by the primary account holder or their designee, but always with notice to the end-user). T-Mobile follows the CTIA&#146;s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available <a href="http://www.ctia.org/policy-initiatives/voluntary-guidelines/best-practices-and-guidelines-for-location-based-services">here</a>.</p>

        <br />

         <strong>Advertising</strong> 

        <p>You may see advertisements when you visit our websites, mobile websites, in mobile applications, or on your device. We may help advertisers better reach our customers by providing certain information, including device type, geographic information, language preferences or demographic information obtained from other companies to allow advertisers to determine which ads may be more relevant to you. However, we do not share Personal Information for advertising purposes outside of our corporate family without your consent.</p>

        <br />
         

        <p>Some examples of the types of advertising you might see include:</p>

        <br />
         

        <p><i>Our Ads on Our Websites.</i> We may provide advertisements, such as banner ads, on our websites, mobile websites, and in mobile applications and widgets you may download, access or use on your device.</p>

        <br />
         

        <p><i>Other Company Ads on Our Websites.</i> You may also see third-party advertisements on some T-Mobile websites, services, or in applications, or on devices. These third-party advertisers, or their ad networks, may place or access cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your device, or use your device identifier, and may collect certain anonymous or de-identified information about your visit on our websites. The third-party advertisers who provide these ads may use this information to provide you with advertising on our websites, as well as on other websites. We do not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer or device by ad servers, ad networks, or third-party advertisers.</p>

        <br />
         

        <p><i>Our Ads on Other Websites.</i> We may ask third-parties to place advertisements about our products and services on other websites, mobile websites and in mobile applications and widgets. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-parties on other websites is subject to any applicable privacy policies that they may have, not this Policy.</p>

We may, however, disclose your information to unaffiliated third-parties as follows:</p>

        <br />
         <strong>With Your Consent</strong> 

        <p>We may disclose Personal Information about you to third-parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent in writing; online, through "click-through" agreements; when you accept the terms of disclosures on your phone for certain applications or services; orally, in our stores or on the phone, including through interactive voice response, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery.</p>
        <strong>To the Primary Account Holder</strong> 

        <p>We may disclose information about an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide information about you or your use of the service, products or devices to them or others at their direction.</p>

        <p>When you are the primary account holder, but you receive special or discounted pricing, terms, or other benefits through another party&#146;s agreement with us (for example, an employee discount), we may provide enough information to that party to verify your initial and continuing eligibility for benefits under their agreement with us and to calculate any associated discounts.</p>
        <strong>To Our Service Providers</strong> 

        <p>We may disclose information to third-party vendors and partners who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf (for example, credit/debit card processing, billing, shipping, repair, customer service, auditing, and marketing).</p>
        <strong>Third-Party Carriers and Suppliers</strong> 

        <p>If you are roaming on the network of another carrier, your wireless telephone number, your location, the numbers you dial, and other information about your usage will be available to that carrier to facilitate that service. Additionally, services and functionality offered through certain devices are sometimes provided in conjunction with entities other than T-Mobile. As a result, Personal Information from your devices may be uploaded and stored on their servers. For instance, BlackBerry&reg; service is provided in conjunction with Research in Motion (RIM), and Personal Information from your device is stored on their BlackBerry Enterprise ServersTM. Their specific terms and conditions, terms of use, and privacy polices apply to those services.</p>
        <strong>In a Business Transfer</strong> 

        <p>We may sell, disclose, or transfer information about you as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which such information could be transferred to third-parties as a business asset in the transaction.</p>
        <strong>For Legal Process &amp; Protection</strong> 

        <p>We may disclose Personal Information, and other information about you, or your communications, where we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li>

          <li>To enforce or apply agreements, or initiate, render, bill, and collect for services and products (including to collection agencies in order to obtain payment for our products and services);</li>

          <li>To protect our rights or interests, property or safety or that of others;</li>

          <li>In connection with claims, disputes, or litigation &#150; in court or elsewhere;</li>

          <li>To protect users of our services and other carriers or providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services;</li>

          <li>To facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or</li>

          <li>In an emergency situation.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Co-Sponsored Websites and Partners</strong> 

        <p>If you provide information to us in connection with a co-sponsored website, this Policy will apply to our use of the information and the co-sponsor&#146;s policy will apply to their use of the information. If you purchase equipment or activate service at one of our partner&#146;s locations (including websites of such dealer or retailer), they may request information from you that is passed to us as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by the partner. This Policy will govern our use of such information, and the partner&#146;s privacy policy will govern its use of such information.</p>
        <strong>De-Identified Information</strong> 

        <p>We may provide information that does not identify you personally to third-parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes.</p>
        <strong>Third-Party Applications for Your Devices</strong> 

        <p>We are not responsible for the third-party applications (for example, applications, programs, widgets, etc.) you select and install on your device. When you install third party applications, you may give your consent for the third party to access information stored on the device and on our network to facilitate the application&#146;s functions (for example, you may consent to third-party access to your location information &#150; see Location Based Services). The manner in which such third-parties may use, share, or disclose such information is governed by the terms and conditions and privacy policy provided by that third party &#150; not by this Policy.

        </div>
        <strong>Protecting Your Information</strong> 

        <p>We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure while it is under our control.</p>

        <p>We provide password protected online access to your account information through my.t-mobile.com. For multi-line accounts, the primary account holder is authorized to access online account information for all the devices and lines on the account. Other users may generally access online account information related only to their respective device and line (for example, if a parent provides a device to their child, the child may access online information about that device and line&#150; including CPNI). The primary account holder, however, may designate additional or more limited access rights for other users on the account.</p>

        <p>Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules. We will not intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your permission, except as allowed under FCC rules, applicable law, or explained in this Policy. However, if you are the primary account holder, you may designate other "authorized users" (for example, a spouse) to access and manage your account information, including CPNI. For more information see <a href="/Company/PrivacyResources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_CPNI">Privacy Resources/Customer Proprietary Network Information</a></p>
        <strong>Retention and Disposal</strong> 

        <p>We retain information only for as long as we have a business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).</p>
