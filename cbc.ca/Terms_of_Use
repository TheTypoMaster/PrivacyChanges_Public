2.CBC/Radio-Canada content

May I use CBC/Radio-Canada content?
No, unless otherwise authorized. CBC/Radio-Canada does not allow the reproduction or public communication of content that it produces or commissions, so as to protect the credibility and integrity of content that it broadcasts and to ensure fulfilment of the agreements with its authors, artists and others partners. Your access to CBC/Radio-Canada digital services does not give you any rights to that content.
As Canada’s public broadcaster, CBC/Radio-Canada produces content or commissions it from third parties. That content usually requires working with partners or the public and negotiating rights with media artists, news agencies, authors, musicians and performers, for the use of pictures (videos, photos, drawings) and material from third-parties; those rights are protected by law.
To be allowed to reproduce or present certain content in public, you must first obtain a licence from CBC/Radio-Canada, unless use is permitted by law or by special notice in connection with a program or interactive activity, subject to the terms and conditions stated therein.

Do these terms of use apply to news feeds (RSS)?
Yes. These terms also apply to the use of CBC/Radio-Canada news feeds. Any use other than for private purposes must be subject to an agreement specifying the conditions for use with due regard for the integrity of the content. You agree not to frame the news feed or its content, nor to use similar means to generate unauthorized benefits.

May I repost content from CBC/Radio-Canada digital services?
Yes, but only by hyperlinks or by special permission. You may place links to CBC/Radio-Canada digital pages on your own web pages or sites or on social media. You may not repost content from CBC/Radio-Canada digital services in any other way without first obtaining a licence. CBC/Radio-Canada may, at its sole discretion, intervene to remove content communicated to the public without authorization on third-party sites and take legal action to enforce its rights.

What rights do I have to software and applications made available for my use by CBC/Radio-Canada digital services?
Only for navigating. Some web activities require the use of software or applications—e.g., digital markers including cookies—specifically developed for such purpose. When such software and applications are made available to you, you have the right to download and use them for the sole purpose as intended by CBC/Radio-Canada, but you have no other rights to reproduce, modify or adapt them for any purposes whatsoever.

 Who should I address if I feel that content on CBC/Radio-Canada digital services infringes my rights (copyright, image)?
Audience Services. You must notify Audience Services as soon as possible.

You must, in fact, hold the rights to the material being infringed. On receiving such notification, CBC/Radio-Canada will investigate as required and make the appropriate decisions.

Does CBC/Radio-Canada use tools such as web analytics?

What security protocols are used when I use social media?
Those of CBC/Radio-Canada and the social media platforms, as the case may be. CBC/Radio-Canada’s use of social media constitutes an extension of its digital presence.

Does CBC/Radio-Canada use information for profiling?
