			In 2003, Xfire released the Xfire Client, the first product to bring the outside world into your games. Since its humble beginnings as a
			simple chat client it has steadily grown to enable users to take screenshots, videos, and live broadcasts and share them on the Xfire
			Social Website. Attracting over 24 million users into a healthy and vibrant community, it set the standard for the socialization of PC
			Games.
		</p>
		<p>
			Twelve years bring a lot of change to an industry. This is especially true in the fast paced world of gaming and the dynamics of the
			industry have changed significantly in this time. Since Xfire was first released, we’ve seen 3 console generations, the advent of mobile
			gaming, the transition from packaged games to digital distribution, and the rise of Free To Play games.
		</p>
		<p>
			We’ve also seen esports grow from small LAN Parties into a maturing industry. Esports has the potential to grow as large as its real
			world counterpart, and at Xfire, we want to be a part of that. For this reason, we have decided to sunset the Xfire Client and the social
			site so we can focus our efforts on <a href="http://xfire.com/" class="link">The Xfire Tournament Platform</a>. This hasn’t been an easy decision. We have a lot of loyal users and
			we know many of you will be disappointed by the loss of the client and community. But we feel that we are well positioned to make a
			significant impact in bringing the exhilaration of esports from the pros to the masses, and we can’t do that effectively while also
			maintaining the client and social website.
		</p>
		<p>
			We’d like to thank our loyal fans and users who have stuck with us over the years and we hope that you’ll join us on the next chapter
			of Xfire either as a tournament organizer, a team owner, a participant, or a spectator.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks again for using Xfire, and we look forward to see you in a tournament in the near future.
		</p>
