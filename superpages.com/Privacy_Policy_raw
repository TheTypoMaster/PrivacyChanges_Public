<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 16, 2015. Our business changes

through This Website is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the
information is collected (unless you consent otherwise as to information
related to you). You are advised to check this web page (or such other page
accessible by clicking on the Privacy Policy link in the footer of This

<h2>Information Dex Media and Non-Dex Media Family Companies Collect, Store, and/or Share<a name=informationcollected></a></h2>
 
<h3>What information does This Website gather, store and/or share?</h3>
 
<p>When you visit This Website, Dex Media may collect, store and/or share the following types of
information: </p>
 
<ul type=disc>
 <li>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</li>
 <li>Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information Dex Media Collects Automatically</li>
 <li>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide </li>
</ul>
 
<p><u>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</u>. Dex Media collects and may store and share 
personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For
example, Dex Media may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact
information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). Dex Media will not share credit card information or social security numbers. 
If you purchase a product or service, Dex Media may ask you to provide additional
information such as your credit card information. If you register for the SuperGuarantee&reg; Program, Dex Media will ask you to
provide additional information about any service appointment you register and
may track your searches and any registrations, claims and ratings/reviews you
file on This Website. If you file a claim under the SuperGuarantee&reg;
Program or apply for the Superpages LocalServe&reg; Program, Dex Media may ask you to provide
additional information such as your Social Security number. If you request
information relating to the sale or purchase of a vehicle on This Website, we
may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information and
information relating to the vehicle. Finally, in some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in
on This Website or purchase a product or service) Dex Media may also ask you
to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question
and answer, and birthday.</p>
 
<p>If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to
send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for
certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient's name,
e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address.
Dex Media uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to
facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use
such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking
the success of the referral feature). You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.</p>

 
<p><u>Personally and Nonpersonally Information Automatically Collected.</u>. In addition, as you (and other users)
browse This Website, our web servers, and non &#8220;Dex Media Family&#8221; companies
with which Dex Media has an agreement may, automatically collect and track certain
information about such visits, usually through the use of browser <a
href="http://www.superpages.com/about/privacy.html#Cookies">cookies</a>,
JavaScript files and tagging, web address tracking codes, file impression
counts, &quot;web beacons&quot;, and the analysis of http headers
(&#8220;Tracking Methods&#8221;). These Tracking Methods provide information such as the user's IP
address, the user's domain name, the user's browser type, the user's user
agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for
how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet
address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the
links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, Dex Media may
collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user
which are not entered by the user.</p>
 
<p>
Dex Media may collect and store information, including personally identifiable information, 
related to your usage of third-party sites that you access through the Websites, including emails 
that you send through the Websites. 
</p>
 
<p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</u>. In
some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that
you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct
through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code. </p>
 
<p>To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This
Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We
will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are
aware of developments in this area. </p>
 
<h3>How does Dex Media use, store and share information collected on This Website?</h3>
 
<p><u>Specific Purpose</u>. When users supply personally
identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example,
to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service,
to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a
program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use, store, and/or share such
information for such purpose.</p>
 
<p><u>Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner</u>. 
We also may use, store and/or share personally identifiable
information users provide as we would use, store and/or share the same information obtained in a
traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally
identifiable information to assess your credit rating. We may also use 
store and/or share this information to publish your name,
address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a
non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are
participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs, and to
contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide
personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This
Website, we may also use, store and/or share such personally identifiable information in connection
with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the
personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable
information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful
service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may
publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When
users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest,
sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use, store and/or share such
information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify
winners. </p>
 
<p><u>Communicate with You</u>. We
may also use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide or that is
automatically collected to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and
to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to
send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing
information about our products and services or the products and services of
other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your
registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online
and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive
(i.e., &quot;opt-out&quot; of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the
primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a
commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by
clicking on <a
href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp"
target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the
e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the
e-mail campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving
commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel
your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages
from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by
clicking on <a
href="http://account.dexmedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp"
target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the
e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the
e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send
certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see
information about <a
href="http://www.superpages.com/about/privacy.html#email">e-mails</a>,

the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you
reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad
serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data. </p>
 
<p>Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from
reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies
each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or
opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is
erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new
cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to
attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not
contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify
your computer uniquely. </p>
 
<p>Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have
their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your
