The arbitrator selected to resolve the dispute between you and Tagged shall bound by the terms of this Agreement. All arbitration hearings shall take place exclusively in <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref">58</a></sup> San Francisco County, California. Except, however, that if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less you may choose whether the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephone hearing, or by an in-person hearing, as established by the AAA Rules. <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref">59</a></sup> If the total amount you are seeking is greater than $10,000 then your and Tagged's respective rights to an arbitration hearing shall be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based.</p>

<p>In addition to any reimbursement of AAA filing fees as detailed above, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less, Tagged shall pay all other AAA administration fees and all arbitrator fees for the arbitration. Except, however, that if the arbitrator in such action finds that either the substance of your dispute against Tagged or the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees in such action shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In said event, you hereby agree to reimburse Tagged for all monies paid by Tagged that are your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref">60</a></sup> Additionally, if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is greater than $10,000 then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>

<p><sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref">61</a></sup> You and Tagged agree that unless and until the arbitrator determines the monetary and/or other relief, if any, to which you and/or Tagged is entitled in connection with the dispute being arbitrated, neither you nor Tagged shall disclose to the arbitrator the amount of any settlement offer(s) that you and/or Tagged previously made to the other in connection with said dispute. In any individual arbitration between you and Tagged, <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref">62</a></sup> if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Tagged's last written settlement offer to you then Tagged shall:</p>

<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against Tagged in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").</li>
</ul>

<p><sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref">63</a></sup> However, if Tagged did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said individual arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against Tagged, you and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Member Incentive and the Attorney Incentive, respectively. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the individual arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or Tagged made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said individual arbitration. The Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the individual arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If Tagged prevails in an individual arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, Tagged hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award.</p>

<p>The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief in your favor, but solely to the extent warranted by your individual Claim.

<p><sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref">67</a></sup> However, if Tagged did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said consolidated arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against Tagged, then you shall be entitled to receive the award and/or $500, whichever is greater, and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Attorney Incentive. As also noted above, the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the consolidated arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or Tagged made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said arbitration. Similarly, the Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the consolidated arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If Tagged prevails in a consolidated arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, Tagged hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award. If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.</p>

<p><sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref">68</a></sup> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if Tagged changes this Dispute provision in the future (other than a change to the Tagged Notice Address and/or any Internet address, telephone number and/or document title set forth in this provision) you may reject that change by sending written notice within 30 days of the change to Tagged at the Tagged Notice Address. By rejecting said change you reaffirm that you shall seek to resolve all disputes between you and Tagged solely through arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="tagged_use_of_information">Tagged’s Use of Your Information</h3>

<p><sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup> Tagged uses certain of your personal information to enable you to interact, or to enhance your experience, with the Site and its features.

To make searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the Site easier we allow Members to search for other Members using a first and last name, an email address, a location or schools that the Member may have attended.
