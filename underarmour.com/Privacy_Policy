  Security and Privacy Policy






  Last Revised: May 4, 2015Welcome to ua.com, Under Armour’s shopping
website (“Under Armour Shopping”).   This
Privacy Statement applies to all personal information and location information we
collect or acquire about you through Under Armour Shopping or Under Armour
Connected Fitness (described below)(collectively, the “Services”) and through
any other media channels and platforms, whether online, offline, print,
telephonic, mobile, wireless, or otherwise, whether collected or acquired by
Under Armour, Inc. (“Under Armour”) MapMyFitness, Inc. (“MapMyFitness”) or any
other Under Armour subsidiary or affiliate. Certain products, services, and
promotional offers made available by Under Armour and/or MapMyFitness may contain
links to additional or different privacy terms. For example, non-U.S.-based
Under Armour or MapMyFitness web and mobile products and services may employ
privacy terms that differ from those in this Privacy Statement. In the event of
a conflict between this Privacy Statement and such additional or different
privacy terms, the additional or different privacy terms will apply.


  Under Armour recently acquired MapMyFitness and
together we’re bringing you the Under Armour Connected Fitness suite, which
includes all Under Armour and MapMyFitness branded web and mobile fitness
products and services. You can connect to the full suite of Under Armour
Connected Fitness products and services through a single point of sign-on—your
UA Account. Additionally, you will soon be able to use your UA Account to log
in to Under Armour Shopping.  Use of any
Under Armour Connected Fitness products and services is subject to this Privacy
Statement.


  Under Armour Connected Fitness is made available
to you (individually, “you,” and collectively, “users”) by Under Armour and
MapMyFitness, a wholly owned subsidiary of Under Armour (collectively, both
Under Armour and MapMyFitness may be referred to as “We,” “we,” “Our,” or
“our”).
”)


  We have posted this Privacy Statement to let you
know what kind of information we collect when you interact with the Services,
the purposes for which we collect and use your information, how it is handled,
with whom it may be shared, and what choices you have regarding our use of your
information.


  Any capitalized but undefined terms used in this
Privacy Statement have the same meaning as when used in the Terms.


  As we continue to develop our Services and take advantage of
advances in technology, our Privacy Statement may change. Please refer to this
page frequently for the most up-to-date information.


  WHAT TYPES OF
PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE GATHER?


  We collect information about you when you
register to use our Services, connect your social media account, use our
Services, or communicate with us. You can choose not to provide certain
information or opt out of some automated collection of your information, but
then you may not be able to take advantage of certain features or Services. By using
our Services, you grant us permission to process your personal information in
accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Statement.


Personal Information.
When you sign up for a particular Service that requires registration or an
account (collectively, any type of account you may create through Under Armour
or MapMyFitness is referred to in the Terms and this Privacy Statement as
“Account”), we ask you to submit certain personal information. Personal
information is any information that identifies you personally, either alone or
in combination with other information available to us. Personal information may
include, but is not limited to:•Your name, username, email address, date of
birth, gender, and/or Account password;•The phone number assigned to your mobile device,
along with other pertinent information concerning your device, including the
name of your wireless carrier/provider and any device identifier;•Certain information
     concerning your health and physical characteristics;•Any other personally
     identifiable information you share through the Services.


  You may use Under Armour Shopping without registering an
account.  If you choose to check-out as a
guest, we will collect limited personal information from you in order to
fulfill your order, but once your order is completed, we will not retain your
personal information except as may be reasonably necessary to document our
business activities or as needed for required disclosures.


Social Media
Connection. You may choose to enable or log in to the Services via various
social media or social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter (“Social
Networking Services”). By integrating these Social Networking Services into our
Services, we can offer you a richer and more personalized experience with our
products and services. When you connect your Account to a social media account,
we collect certain personal information that you have provided to that Social
Networking Service. For example, when you log in with your Facebook
credentials, we may collect personal information from your Facebook profile,
such as your email address, profile picture, and friend list.


Payment Method
Information. For certain Services, we request that you furnish certain
financial information, including but not limited to, credit card or other
payment account information.


Location Information.
Some Under Armour Connected Fitness Services use location-based components. To
provide these features, we or our partners and licensees may collect, use, and
share precise location information, including the real-time geographic location
of your mobile device. For some third-party partners, such as Google, this
location information may be shared automatically. For others, such as Facebook,
location information will only be shared with your explicit permission or if
you choose to share it via the device. Location information includes, but is
not limited to, any information we derive in order to identify your geographic
position. This information may be collected from your wireless carrier, certain
third party service providers, or directly from the mobile device with which
you use or access our Services. The collection and tracking of your location
information may occur even when our Services, including any mobile application,
are not actively open and running. Your location information, however, is only
displayed and shared in accordance with your established privacy settings.


  We may combine the personal information and/or
the location information that you provide via your Account with information
from other Services or third parties in order to enhance your experience and/or
to improve the overall quality of the Services. For certain Services, we may
give you an opportunity to opt out of the combination of such information.


Other Information You
Provide. When you employ our Services, we may receive certain non-personally
identifiable information about your use of the Services. Such information,
which may be collected passively using various technologies or via submission
of data by devices you may have configured to work with the Services, cannot
presently be used to specifically identify you. We may store such information
ourselves, or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our
respective affiliates, agents, and/or service providers. We may use such
information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total
number of visitors to the Services, the number of visitors to each page of the
Services, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. No
personal information is available or used in this process.


Information From Other Sources. If
you have created an Account with us, we may obtain certain demographic
information about you from reputable third party sources to help us improve our
communication with you and improve our business overall.


Aggregated Information.
To better serve you and improve the Services, we may conduct research on
demographics, interests, and behavior based on personal information and other
information provided via the Services. This research may be compiled and
analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated information
with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. This aggregate information
does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated information
in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners
and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.


Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies. When you access or use the Services, we and third parties that provide
certain functionality on our Services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and ad
networks, may engage, receive, collect, and store certain types of information
through automatic data collection tools including cookies, pixel tags, Web
beacons, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information gathering
tools (“Automatic Data Collection Tools”). These Automatic Data Collection
Tools collect certain information including, but not limited to, information
such as your web requests, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser
language, the date and time of your request, referring/exit pages and URLs,
platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and
the order of those pages, cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, and
elements employed in the Mobile Applications.


Cookies. A “cookie” is a small data file stored by your web
browser on your computer’s hard drive. It allows us to recognize your computer
(but not specifically who is using it) when you visit one of the Services by
associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other user
information you have provided us. That user information is stored on our
secured database. Some cookies will remain on the hard drive of your computer or
mobile device for the duration of your browsing session, while others will
remain for longer periods of time or will remain unless and until deleted by
you. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some
cookies (other than Flash cookies) or notify you when a cookie is set. Each
browser is different, so please check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn
how to change your cookie preferences. Please note that some of our Services or
features may not function properly or at all if cookies are disabled or
blocked.


  Some third party service providers may use
“Flash cookies,” also known as Local Shared Objects or LSOs.  Flash cookies are saved on your computer in
the same way as other cookies, but they cannot be rejected, disabled, turned
off, opted out of, or deleted in the same way as regular cookies.  For information on how to manage and remove
Flash cookies, please visit: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html
or epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html.


Pixel Tags. “Pixel tags” (also known as “tracking pixels” or
“web beacons”) are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our
Services. The use of pixel tags is industry standard technology used by most
major web sites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet
Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag
appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag
appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of
browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie
on the computer previously placed by that server. One of the ways in which we
use pixel tags is through a third-party service provider to serve ads on our
behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous (other than your IP
address) information about your visits to and interaction with our Services.
They may also use this information about your visits to the Services and other
websites and applications to target advertisements for goods and services. If
you would like more information about online marketing practices and to know
your choices about not having this information used by our third party service
providers, please click www.networkadvertising.org/choices.


  Please see the section below titled “How Do We
Use Automatic Data Collection Tools?” for more information about our use of
these tools and your choices related to automatic data collection.


  HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?


  When you sign up for a particular Service that
requires an Account, we may ask you to provide certain personal information or
location information. If we intend to use this personal information in a manner
different than the purpose for which it was collected, we will ask you for your
specific consent prior to such use. If we propose to use personal information
in ways that are less restrictive than those described in this Privacy
Statement and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an
effective way to opt out of such use of your personal information for such
identified other purposes. In addition, you may decline to submit personal
information or location information to any of the Services; this may mean,
however, that we are unable to provide certain Services to you.


  We process and use personal information and
location information for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement
and/or any specific privacy notices set forth for select Services. In addition
to the above, such purposes may include:•Operating, maintaining, and providing you all of
the features of the Services, including the display of customized content and
advertising;•Providing the basic
     functionality of the Mobile Applications, such as displaying your live
     location and movement;•Employing “reverse geo-coding” and your IP
address or saved location information to provide you with specialized route and
event content;•Contacting you to deliver
     special offers, promotions, or other information;•Auditing, research, and analysis in order to
maintain, protect, and enhance the Services;•Ensuring the functionality
     and usability of the Services;•Installing and monitoring
     elements for security and/or credit or fraud prevention purposes;•Creating user profiles
     that permit us to better understand what information a given user of our
     Services might like to receive from us;•Providing you with
     information and notices related to the Services;•Inviting you to
     participate in surveys conducted by us and/or our affiliates;•Developing new products
     and services; and•Improving our marketing and promotional efforts.


Email Communications. To improve
our email communications, we may receive a confirmation when you open email
messages from the Services, if your computer supports such capabilities. We
also compare our users list to lists received from other companies in an effort
to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you do not want to
receive email messages or other communications from us, please see the section titled
“How can you opt out of receiving communications from us?” below.


Direct Marketing. Each user that has
registered or created an Account, has the choice of receiving announcements
about our products, services, and special events or promotions from us via
email, and/or text messaging. You will receive promotional email messages from both MapMyFitness and UA if you have agreed to receive them from MapMyFitness or UA or both by (i) registering for an Account via the mobile in-app registration process,
(ii) leaving the check in the box next to the invitation to receive
announcements, news, and promotions when registering or creating your Account via
website, or (iii) clicking on an “Email Signup” link on the Services and entering
your email address. You will receive promotional text messages from us only if
you have agreed to receive them by providing your mobile phone number when you
register or create an Account.


HealthKit Data.  You can chose to connect and share your MapMyFitness and UA Record information with HealthKit and your HealthKit information with MapMyFitness and UA Record.  The information you provide to HealthKit is then governed by the Apple Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.  The unique information you chose to send from HealthKit is not used by Under Armour for marketing and advertising or transferred by Under Armour to third parties for marketing and advertising.


  YOUR CHOICES


UA Account Privacy
Settings and Online Disclosures. Certain Websites and Mobile Applications
available through the Services come equipped with privacy settings for your
profile and activities. For these Websites and Mobile Applications, we provide
you with three privacy setting options for your UA Account—“Public. Share With
Everyone,” “Friends. Share With All My Friends,” and “Private. Do Not Share.”
These privacy settings control who can view your online disclosures, including
but not limited to certain personal information, location information, and activity
data.


  The default UA Account privacy setting is
“Friends. Share With All My Friends.” The “Friends. Share With All My Friends”
privacy setting limits access to your online disclosures. While you maintain a
“Friends. Share With All My Friends” privacy setting, only certain personal
information—specifically, your username, first name, and first initial of your
last name, and any profile picture associated with you—that you disclose and/or
transmit to us via the Websites and/or Mobile Applications is disclosed or
accessible to the public. All other personal information, location information,
and activity data that you disclose and/or transmit is only disclosed to and
accessible by us and those persons who you have designated as “Friends.”


  A “Private. Do Not Share” privacy setting
further limits access to the personal information, location information, and
activity data that you disclose and/or transmit via the Websites and/or Mobile
Applications. Specifically, while you maintain a “Private. Do Not Share”
privacy setting, no personal information, location information, or activity
data that you disclose and/or transmit to us is disclosed to or accessible by
your Friends or the public. It is only disclosed to and accessible by us.


  To permit the public or any third parties, including other
users of our Services, to view personal information, location information, and
activity data, you must actively and specifically employ a “Public. Share With
Everyone” privacy setting.


  When you record and log activities (e.g., routes, food, workouts) in
connection with your use of the Services, you may be permitted to designate a
privacy setting specific to those activities by selecting an icon that
corresponds to one of the privacy settings —“Public. Share With Everyone,”
“Friends. Share With All My Friends,” and “Private. Do Not Share.” The privacy
setting that you set for the logged activity at that time will apply only to
that activity.


  We recommend that you actively manage your privacy settings
on an ongoing basis, so that you can effectively guard against the unauthorized
use or misuse of your personal information or location information by others.


  HOW DO WE USE AUTOMATIC
DATA COLLECTION TOOLS?


Purposes for Which Automatic Data Collection Tools are Used: We use Automatic Data Collection Tools to:


  For
more information on how to turn off certain Automatic Data Collection Tools,
please see the section on “Cookies” and “Pixel Tags” above.


Third Party Data
Collection on Our Services. Please note that certain third parties whom we
do not control use Automatic Data Collection Tools on
our Services. When you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based ads through one of the links below, these Automatic
Data Collection Tools may still collect information
about your use of the Services for other purposes, such as analytics and
fraud prevention.


  ONLINE ADVERTISING


On Our Services. We
may use personal information and data collected through Automatic Data
Collection Tools to deliver personalized Under Armour, MapMyFitness, or third-party
interest-based advertising to you on our Services. For example, there may be separate products and services offered by
third parties advertised on or through our Services that may be complementary
to your use of our Services. If you choose to use these separate products or
services, disclose information to the third party providers, or grant them
permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information
is governed by their own privacy policies; Under Armour and MapMyFitness are
not responsible for these third party privacy practices.  If you click on a link to a third party site
or are considering using a third party providers’ products or services, we
encourage you to check and evaluate the privacy policy on that third party’s
website.


  Please see “How
You Can Opt-Out of Online Tracking and Receiving Interest-Based Advertisements”
for more information about your choices.


On Third Party
Websites. We work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies,
such as Automatic Data Collection Tools, to serve advertisements on our behalf
across the Internet. These companies may
collect information about your use of the Services and your interaction with
our advertising and other communications. If you would like more information
about this practice and to know your choices about not having your information
used by these companies, please see “How You Can Opt-Out of Online Tracking and Receiving
Interest-Based Advertisements” below and/or visit www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.


  These third party service providers may have
access to user personal information needed to perform their functions, but may
not use such information for any purpose other than the function which we have
directed them to perform on our behalf. We require such third party service
providers to implement and maintain reasonable security measures to safeguard
the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your personal information.


  HOW YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF ONLINE TRACKING AND RECEIVING
INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISEMENTS:


  If you want to “opt out” of
tracking for purposes of serving you online interest-based advertisements,
please follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/;
except, you must click here to opt-out of tracking while using Safari web
browser or while on mobile devices.


  When you “opt out” using any one or all three of
these options, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed
on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based
advertisements. If you delete cookies on your device
generally, please keep in mind that you will
need to opt-out again.


Please Note: When you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based
advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from
us or on the Services. It means that the online ads that you do see will not be
targeted to you based on your particular interests. We may still collect
information about you and your use of the Services for any purpose permitted
under the Privacy Statement, including for
analytics and fraud prevention.


  HOW MAY WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?


  Information about our users is an important part of our
business, and we do not sell it to others. We share user information as
described below.


With Your Consent. We may share your personal
information and/or location information where you have consented to the
disclosure. Other than as described in this Privacy Statement, you will receive
notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have
an opportunity to choose not to share the information.


With Third Party Service Providers. We
may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers
retained in connection with the provision of our Services.


For Protection of
Under Armour, MapMyFitness, and Others. We release Account and other
personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the
law; enforce or apply our Terms and other agreements; or protect the rights,
property or safety of our company, our users, or others. This includes
exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
and credit risk reduction.


Merger, Acquisition,
Sale, or Transfer of Assets or Business. If Under Armour and/or
MapMyFitness is acquired by or merged with or into another entity, or if our
assets or business is sold or transferred to another entity, your personal information
may be transferred to such entity as part of the transaction, and that entity
and its affiliates may use your personal information under the terms of their
own privacy policies which may differ from this Privacy Statement.

  LINKS TO THIRD PARTY
WEBSITES: 


  The Services may contain links to certain
third-party websites. We do not own, control, or operate such linked sites, and
we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such linked
sites. Privacy policies and practices for such linked sites may differ from this
Privacy Statement and our practices. Your access and use of such linked sites
is entirely and solely at your own risk. We urge you to read the privacy
policies of such linked sites before disclosing your personal information on
such sites.


  THIRD PARTY
APPLICATIONS:


  You may be able to access certain third party applications
or content (collectively, “Third Party Applications”) via your UA Account. If
you choose to access these Third Party Applications, you may be requested to
log-in and sync your UA Account with such applications. You are in no way
obligated to use any Third Party Applications, and your access and use of such
applications is entirely and solely at your own risk. If you opt to use Third
Party Applications via your UA Account, they will gain access to certain
information that you have provided to us, including personal information, and
they will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance with their
individual privacy policies. The manner in which Third Party Applications use,
store, and disclose your information is governed solely by their individual
privacy policies and terms and conditions. 
We have no liability or responsibility for the privacy and information
security practices or other actions of any Third Party Applications that you choose
to access through your UA Account.


  WHAT ARE OUR SECURITY
POLICIES?


  We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the
industry-standard encryption technology for internet transmission of your
personal information. When the letters “http” in the URL change to “https,” the
“s” indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may
give a pop-up message stating that you are about to enter or leave a secure
area. Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is
encoded/encrypted when it is sent over the Internet. When you see VeriSign's
logo on our secure checkout pages, be assured that your information is being
transmitted via our secure servers.


  Ultimately, if you register an Account, your Account
and personal information is protected by the password you provided when you
created your Account or updated your password while logged into your Account. Always
keep this password and login information private and never share it with
anyone. Also, remember to sign off your Account and close your browser window
when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access
your Account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are
using a computer in a public place.


  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and no
data storage can be 100% secure. Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard
your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not
warrant or guarantee the security of any personal information you transmit to,
from or through our Services. We will notify you in the event we become aware
of a security breach involving your personal information stored by or for us. By
disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you expressly consent to
receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach.


  CHANGES TO THIS
PRIVACY STATEMENT:


  We may update this Privacy Statement from time
to time without prior notice. You can determine when this Privacy Statement was
last revised by referring to the “Last Updated" legend at the top of this
page. Any changes to our statement will become effective upon posting of the
updated Privacy Statement. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy
Statement to ensure familiarity with the most current version of it. If you have
registered or created an Account, we may notify you of any changes to this Privacy
Statement via email and may ask you to affirmatively acknowledge consent to the
changes (e.g., by checking a box or clicking a button) at the time of your next
Account login to our Services.


  SPECIAL NOTE TO
PARENTS:


  We take the privacy of children seriously. The Services are
not directed at children and our Terms prohibit children under the age of 13
from registering for or using the Services. Accordingly, we do not knowingly
collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through our Services,
and we request that children under the age of 13 not submit any personal
information through our Services.
