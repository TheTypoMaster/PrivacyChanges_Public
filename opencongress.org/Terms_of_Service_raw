<li class="top-star">Access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Site, OpenCongress’s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of OpenCongress’s providers;</li>
<li class="top-star">Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach any security or authentication measures;
<li class="top-star">Send unsolicited email, junk mail, “spam,” chain letters, or promotions or advertisements for products or services;</li>
<li class="top-star">Forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or use the Site, Content, Services or User-Generated Content to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information;</li>

You acknowledge that OpenCongress has the right to monitor your access to or use of the Site, Content, Services and User-Generated Content for the purpose of operating the Site, to ensure your compliance with these Terms of Service, or to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body.</p><br />

<h3>Comment Policy</h3>
<p>OpenCongress is designed as a place where users can freely discuss political issues with each other and to collaboratively contribute to the resources on the site. In order to ensure high-quality discussion and contributions, we have some simple and common-sense rules to follow. Failure to abide by these rules may result in a warning by OpenCongress staff or volunteer moderators, or in some instances (for particularly grievous offenses or after repeated warnings), suspension or termination of your commenting privileges, your account, or access to OpenCongress itself.</p>

<ul class="star">

<li class="top-star">Do not harass, stalk, bully, or otherwise abuse any user on OpenCongress. While we welcome healthy debate, there is a clear line between enthusiastic discussion and “flaming”. When in doubt, try to take a step back and see if your actions might be construed as an attack on someone as opposed to healthy disagreement. Remember, if someone harasses you, don’t harass them back – simply report the offending content to us.</li>
<li class="top-star">Do not post any content which could be construed as hate speech – this includes racism, sexism, homophobia, and other such content which may advocate bigotry.</li>
<li class="top-star">Keep posts on-topic. Discussion should remain centered around the topic of the page in question. While discussions can evolve over time, please try to keep your comments related to the original topic.</li>
<li class="top-star">Do not vandalize the site. This can include uploading objectionable content to your profile, maliciously deleting other users’ contributions or making inappropriate edits to the Wiki, and other such actions.</li>
<li class="top-star">Do not spam the site. Repeatedly posting identical comments (“flooding”), posting commercial messages, or the like are not conducive to the site’s purpose and we will respond accordingly.</li>
<li class="top-star">Do not post any content which is invasive of another person’s privacy. This includes posting an individual’s non-public email address, telephone number, address, or other personal details. For instance, posting a Senator’s public office telephone number is acceptable; posting their home telephone number is not.</li></ul><br />

  <h2 id="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
The Sunlight Foundation values your privacy. When you trust us with your
personal information, we take that responsibility seriously. Here’s what we
hope is a readable summary of the most important parts of our Terms of
Service and Privacy Policy:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  We will never sell, rent, share or distribute your personal information
  without your permission.
  </li>
  <li>
  We only collect and store your personal information for login purposes and
  in order to stay in touch with you, and to provide you with the services you choose
  to employ on our site.
  </li>
  <li>
  You can remove yourself from our website whenever you want.
  </li>
  <li>
  We collect analytics about how people use our tools. We use that
  information to improve them, and we sometimes share it with reporters,
  funders and others. But we only share that information at an aggregate
  level; we never share information about individual users.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you use our APIs, we would like your permission to talk about it--this
  helps us secure the resources necessary to keep them going. If you don’t
  like the sound of this, you can opt out of it when you sign up for an API
  key.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Also, hopefully this stuff goes without saying:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Our tools sometimes link to other sites. We are not responsible for the
  privacy practices of those sites, and recommend you read their privacy
  policies for further information.
  </li>
  <li>
  We do our best to provide excellent, reliable and accurate information
  through our tools and services. But nobody’s perfect, and if you encounter
  a problem we’d like to hear about it from your bug report, not your lawyer.
  Everything we publish is offered as-is, without warranty or guarantee.
  </li>
  <li>
  We believe in open source, and we publish things under a variety of open
  licenses. But we have to protect our branding and trademarks; you shouldn’t
  use them to imply that your project is affiliated with us unless you’ve
  gotten our written permission to do so.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
