<p>LinkedIn&rsquo;s mission is to connect the world&rsquo;s professionals to allow them to be more productive and successful. Our registered users (&ldquo;Members&rdquo;) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, and find business and career opportunities. Content on some of our services is also visible to unregistered viewers (&ldquo;Visitors&rdquo;). We believe that our services allow our Members to effectively compete and achieve their full career potential. The cornerstone of our business is to focus on our Members first.</p>

<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We protect your personal information using industry-standard safeguards.</p>
<p>We may share your information with your consent or as required by law, and we will always let you know when we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>Maintaining your trust is our top priority, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>We protect your personal information and will only provide it to third parties: (1) with your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry out your instructions; (3) as reasonably necessary in order to provide our features and functionality to you; (4) when we reasonably believe it is required by law, subpoena or other legal process; or (5) as necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members and Visitors, and the public.</li>
<li>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to LinkedIn.com and the LinkedIn mobile application, SlideShare.net and SlideShare mobile app (&ldquo;SlideShare&rdquo;), Pulse.me and Pulse mobile app (&ldquo;Pulse&rdquo;), LinkedIn platform technology (such as &ldquo;Share on LinkedIn&rdquo; plugins for publishers), the advertising platform created by Bizo Inc. (and its successor products) and all other LinkedIn websites, apps, developer platforms and other products and services (collectively the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Service, or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use our Services. <strong>If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use our Services after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.</strong></p>

<h2> 1. What information we collect </h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row first">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.1. Data Controllers</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to any Member or Visitor. We collect information when you use our Services to offer you a personalized and relevant experience, including growing your network and enabling business opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>If you reside in the United States, then the personal information provided to or collected by our Services is controlled by LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043. If you reside outside the United States, then this personal information is controlled by LinkedIn Ireland, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland. <strong>If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on our Services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a Member, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use our Services.</strong> If you have already registered, you can close your accounts (e.g., <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?closemyaccountstart=">LinkedIn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/53671/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/">SlideShare</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49959/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/">Pulse</a>).</p>
<p>We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.2. Registration</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>When you create an account with us, we collect information (including your name, email address, and password).</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>
To create an account on LinkedIn, you must provide us with at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password and agree to our <a target="_blank" href="/legal/user-agreement">User Agreement</a> and this Privacy Policy, which governs how we treat your information. You may provide additional information during the registration flow (for example, your postal code, job title, and company) to help you build your profile and to provide you more customized services (for example: language-specific profile pages, updates, content, more relevant ads and career opportunities). You understand that, by creating an account, we and others will be able to identify you by your LinkedIn profile. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain additional services.
</p>
<p>We also provide the option to register for a <a target="_blank" href="/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eslideshare%2Enet%2Fsignup&urlhash=5NZq">SlideShare</a> account, for which you must provide at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. We no longer provide the option to register for a separate <a target="_blank" href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/44737/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/">Pulse</a> account, but you may continue to use your existing Pulse account if you already have one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.3. Profile Information</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We collect information when you fill out a profile. A complete LinkedIn profile that includes professional details &ndash; like your job title, education, and skills &ndash; helps you get found by other people for opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>After you create an account (other than the distinct SlideShare and Pulse accounts), you may choose to provide additional information on your LinkedIn <a target="_blank" href="/profile/edit">profile</a>, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information including content. Subject to the settings you choose, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from our Services by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help recruiters and business opportunities find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off of our Services.</p>
<p>On SlideShare, you can choose what personal information you provide in addition to the information required for registration as noted above. Most of your SlideShare profile, as well as all content that you post on SlideShare, is publicly displayed (with the exceptions provided in the SlideShare account settings), so please do not provide personal information you would not want to be public. We may use and share information you provide in a SlideShare profile and/or Pulse account in the same manner as the information provided in a LinkedIn.com profile, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.4. Address Book and Other Services That Sync with LinkedIn</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We collect information when you sync non-LinkedIn content &ndash; like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar &ndash; with your account. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you like.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>You may use our address book or &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; importer (or other similar features) to upload your address book into our Services. We store this information (including phone numbers) and use it to help you manage and leverage your contacts in connection with our Services. We also use this information to enhance your experience with our Services by helping you to grow your network by: identifying your contacts that are already Members of our Services; providing a template to send invitations on your behalf to your contacts that are not Members; and suggesting people you may know (even if not in your contacts) but are not yet connected with you on our Services (as we may infer from your shared connections or shared managers, employers, educational institutions and other such factors). We may also use this information to show you and other Members that you share the same uploaded contacts who may or may not be Members.</p>
<p>Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another individual on our Service (a &ldquo;connection&rdquo;) or to join our Service to connect with you, that person may have access to your email address or, for SMS invitations, mobile number because it may be displayed in the invitation.

<p>We make other tools available to sync information with our Services, and may also develop additional features that allow Members to use their account in conjunction with other third-party services.

<p>Another example are software tools that allow you to see our and other public information about the people you email or meet with and leverage our Services to help you gain insights from and grow your network. If you grant these products (mobile applications or our other Services that sync external email and calendar services, such as &ldquo;LinkedIn Connected&rdquo;) permission to access your email and calendar accounts, they will access and may store some of your email header and calendar history information. Our products that sync with external email services may also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons, in a way that is unreadable by us and our service providers.</p>
<p><strong>Any information that you upload or sync with our Services is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience</strong> using the features we make available or in accordance with Section 3.

<ul>
<li>Advertising technologies on and off of our Services, like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as permitted by mobile platforms;</li>
<li>Member-provided profile and contact information and categories (for example, &ldquo;product managers in Texas&rdquo;);</li>
<li>Information inferred from a Member&lsquo;s profile (for example, using job titles to infer age, industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; or names to infer gender);</li>

Also, advertising partners may associate personal information collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we contractually require such advertisers to obtain your explicit opt-in consent before doing so.</p>
<p>We may show you sponsored content in your network update stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates. If you take social action (for example, if you &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;comment&rdquo; on the sponsored content), your action may be seen by your network and other Members who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it. Please note that all social actions on SlideShare (e.g. liking certain content, following or being followed by others) are public, unless expressly specified otherwise with respect to premium accounts.</p>

<p>Many communications that you initiate through our Services (for example, an invitation sent to a non-Member) will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network).

Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information will be shared with that individual.</p>

<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with LinkedIn) outside of the LinkedIn entity that is your data controller (for example, LinkedIn Corporation may share your information with LinkedIn Ireland, or other LinkedIn operating entities) as reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You are consenting to this sharing.</p>
<p>We combine information internally across different Services. For example, SlideShare may recommend better content to you based on your LinkedIn content preferences and the articles you read on Pulse, and LinkedIn could present you a better tailored network update stream based on your SlideShare activity, whether or not you tied your SlideShare, Pulse and/or LinkedIn accounts (e.g. by signing in SlideShare or Pulse with your LinkedIn account), as we may be able to identify you across different Services using cookies or similar technologies.</p>

<h3 class="copy-header">2.6. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">

<p>We don&rsquo;t provide any of your non-public information (like your email address) to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, or as described in Sections 2.6 and 2.14 of this Policy.</p>
<p>Other people may find your LinkedIn profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter in conjunction with your LinkedIn account.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>We offer a &ldquo;public profile&rdquo; feature that allows you as a Member to publish portions of your professional profile to the public Internet. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your LinkedIn account <a target="_blank" href="/profile/public-profile-settings">settings</a>, or limit the publicly visible information in your SlideShare profile. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. Unless you delete them, your profiles on LinkedIn.com and our corresponding app or on SlideShare.net are always viewable on the respective Services.</p>
<p>The visibility of your professional profile to other Members depends on your degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their <a target="_blank" href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/52950/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/">usage of the Services</a>, access channels and search types (e.g. by name or by keyword). For example, first degree connections can see your full profile and contact information. Others have more limited access, as detailed in our <a target="_blank" href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/77/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/">Help Center</a>. Please note that recruiters and other such professional subscribers can see your full profile even if you did not approve their InMail.</p>
<p>We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on our Services, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with our other services, such as Groups and Company Pages, except to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) or unless we have your separate consent, unless we have a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Services, our Members, Visitors, or the public. See Section 2.14 for additional details about our compliance with legal requests for information.</p>
<p>We support middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to legal and regulatory archiving requirements, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other activity by a third party for compliance purposes. Content distributed through our sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of our Services. For example, when you post content to a Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results.</p>
<p>Also, if you have opted to bind any of your Service accounts to your Twitter, Facebook or other similar account, you can easily share content from our Services to these third party services, in accordance with your account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective policies of these third parties. Further, we allow third parties to look-up profile information (subject to your privacy settings) using your email address or first and last name information through its profile API (see Section 2.7. below).</p>
<p>Third parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload certain information in your contacts stored with us onto their own service. If you choose to share your contacts in this way, you will be granting your third party provider the right to store, access, disclose and use your these contacts in the ways described in such third party's terms and privacy policy.</p>

Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to us.</p>
<p>If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/">settings</a>. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do.

We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personal information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it.

<h3 class="copy-header">2.12. Talent Recruiting, Marketing and Sales Solutions</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We offer a premium service to recruiters and others, which can be used to search for, organize, and communicate with potential candidates or offer business opportunities. In some cases we allow the export of public profile information. You can control how your information is exported by changing which parts of your public profile are accessible to search engines.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>We offer customized people-search functionality along with organizational and communications tools (including activity alerts) as part of our talent recruiting, marketing and sales solutions. These services allow subscribers - generally, enterprises and professional organizations - to export limited information from Members&rsquo; public profiles, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and location (for example, San Francisco Bay Area), in order to effectively manage candidate sourcing. You may limit or prevent such subscribers from exporting your profile information by configuring your <a target="_blank" href="/profile/public-profile-settings">public profile visibility settings</a> to restrict access to these fields. We do not provide email or other contact information to these subscribers. However, if you post that information as part of your profile it will be available to them and others. A recruiter or other such subscriber may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of our Services, such as a resume, in connection with our platform. Any personal information obtained independently of our Services will not be added by us to your profile and is not under our control but is subject to the policies of our recruiting, marketing or sales solution subscriber. We store such information on behalf of such subscriber who can remove it at any time. We do not further process such information.</p>

<p>Companies and other entities can create pages on our Services. If you follow one of these pages, non-identifiable information about you will be provided to the page&rsquo;s administrators.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>Certain pages on the Services are public (e.g., company and college pages), and any communications or information shared through them will be accessible by the entity that created them. If you follow a person or organization, you will be listed among its followers, which can be viewed by others including the page owner.

<p>We may disclose your personal information if compelled by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if necessary to enforce our User Agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a Member or Visitor when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, whether in the United States, Ireland, or other jurisdictions, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the User Agreement, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal information when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but do not commit to challenge every demand. To find out more about how we engage with government requests for data see our <a target="_blank" href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/16880/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/">Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines</a>.</p>

<div class="brief-copy">
<p>You can change your LinkedIn information at any time by editing your profile, deleting content that you have posted, or by closing your account. You can also ask us for additional information we may have about your account.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by LinkedIn regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account. You can request your personal information that is not viewable on your profile or readily accessible to you (for example, your IP access logs) through LinkedIn&lsquo;s <a target="_blank" href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30364/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/">Help Center</a>. If you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?closemyaccountstart=">close your account(s)</a>, your information will generally be removed from the Service within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information and will de-personalize any logs or other backup information through the deletion process within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.</p>
<p>With respect to SlideShare accounts and activity, if you would like us to delete your record and/or remove a particular comment you have made on SlideShare.net, or to provide a copy of any personal information to which you may be entitled, please contact us at privacy@slideshare.com. We will remove your information from SlideShare.net within 24 hours and delete and/or de-personalize it from our systems within 30 days of closure, except as noted below.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Information you have shared with others (for example, through InMail, network updates, content sharing, or Groups) or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Members copied or exported out of our Services, because this information may not be in our control. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.</p>

</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>We retain the personal information you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you services. We may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between Members, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Our Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with Section 3.1., except in the case of our plugin impression data (i.e., the information that you visited on sites carrying our social plugin, but which you did not click on), which we de-personalize within 7 days (although we do maintain 30 days worth of webserver logs for security, debugging, and site stability purposes only) by creating aggregate data sets that cannot be traced back to individuals.</p>
