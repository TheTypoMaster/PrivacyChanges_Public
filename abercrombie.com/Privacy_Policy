AD COOKIE POLICY
How Third Parties Serve You Our Advertisements On Other Websites and Your Choices
We contract with third party advertising companies to serve you online display and banner advertisements on other websites.  To serve this advertising, these third parties may place, use or rely on technology, such as cookies and/or Pixel Tags (which are described below in the privacy policy), to collect information about your interactions with our Websites and Apps (both defined below in the privacy policy) and interactions with other websites. These advertising companies may use and share the information gathered to deliver our ads more tailored to your interests on other websites that are a part of their online advertising networks and/or search engines.  We receive aggregate information from these third parties to gauge our advertising effectiveness.
For information about opt out programs these third party advertising companies participate in and the effect of opting out, click on the following: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (you will leave this Website for a centrally managed online site where you can specify your preference under those programs).  You can also click on the icon that may appear on some of our advertising served through these technologies.  We may use more than one third party company for placing this advertising, which would require you to opt out of each company.

Information Collected Online
1. General Browsing
We collect general information about our visitors’ experience with our Websites and this general information is not connected to personally identifiable information about individual visitors. The information collected includes which pages our visitors are viewing on our Websites and whether visitors arrived through a link for our Websites.  It also includes information on the type of browser and service provider used.  For visitors using a mobile version of our Websites, this includes technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookie support by the device and how images may appear.   All of this information helps us provide a better experience for our visitors by being able to determine such things as how to best format our mobile Websites for various devices, our most desired pages, products and features, how to best direct visitors to our Websites, and where there might be browser or service provider connection issues.
2. Location Information
Our Websites and emails include features that require collecting different types of location information that we use for the specific feature, such as:

Check-In.  If you decide to check-in at one of our stores, we collect your specific location information.  This requires that you enable the location-based services on your mobile device, and allow us to access your current location.
Find A Store and Find In Store.  Our Websites allow you to search for the nearest store and whether nearby stores have certain items in stock.  If you access our Website through a mobile device and you have enabled location-based services, specific location information may be collected for these features.  If you access these features through a desktop device, you can choose to have your browser provide us your location information to respond to your request. The specificity of the desktop device location information can vary depending on the browser you are using.
Email.  Our emails may use your IP address to determine the city where you are located when you open the email.  This allows us to tailor content to you, such as a map of nearby stores.

Mobile devices referenced above include your cell phone, and could include your laptop or tablet depending on the type of wireless connectivity used. If you do not consent to provide or disable location-based services, we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip code; if you chose not to provide this information some features of the Websites may not be available.  See the “Opt-Out” section below for the choices you have regarding collection of location information. 
3. Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

We also collect information through use of cookies, pixel tags (also known as Web beacons and clear GIFs) and URL links, as described under "Cookies" below.

To create an account on our Websites or to participate in certain features, our Websites may allow you to chose to let us access information from accounts you have created on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and other similar sites (“Personal Social Media Accounts”). If you chose to allow us access to your Personal Social Media Accounts, Abercrombie & Fitch could collect some, and possible all, of the data in the Personal Social Media Account to which you grant access.  Depending on the terms of the social media site, this information could include: your name, email address, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, birthday, likes, education history, work history, current city, hometown, interests, relationship status, and location.  Once you grant this permission, Abercrombie & Fitch will be able to continue to be linked to the permitted Personal Social Media Account and collect information without a further request for permission, which could include later revisions to existing information or new types of information that you add.  If you no longer want your Personal Social Media Account(s) linked to our Websites, click on the ‘disconnect’ link located on our Websites near the corresponding social media button and we will stop collecting this information.  You may also be able to stop our ability to link to information in your Personal Social Media Account by following instructions provided on the applicable social media sites.

Cookies
What Are Cookies, Pixel Tags and URL Links, and How Are These Used on Our Websites or in Our Emails?
Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may use, a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer or device. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device. The information collected when visiting our Websites may include the following: an IP address, the URL of the page from which you arrived; your browser type; other technical information about your device used to visit our Websites; the pages you view; the features you use; whether you create an account or become a member in The A&F; Club program (collectively “Membership”), or sign in and where you go on our Websites once signed into your Membership; whether you complete a transaction; whether you have previously completed a survey; and the time of your visit. This information allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Websites are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of the Websites, your specific interaction with our Websites and difficulties you may experience in accessing our Websites. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our Websites by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, personalize your experience, and resolve access difficulties. In addition, our Websites use cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, whether you purchase any or all of those items, and to tell us whether you have visited one of our Websites in the past. This allows you to maintain shopping carts between visits and allows us to inquire about your continued interest in items in your shopping cart or that you viewed on one of our Websites. Our Websites also use cookies to help keep track of checkout information, other than payment method information, while you remain on our site. In addition, the information collected by us or our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may also use, Pixel Tags (also known as Web beacons, Web bugs, and Clear GIFs) on the Websites and in emails. A Pixel Tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Webpage or email message. Pixel Tags may be used to collect the same information about your visit that is collected through cookies, as noted above. We may also collect information about a search engine used, and a search engine advertisement clicked to navigate to the Websites. Pixel Tags in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails (including your interaction with our Websites as a result of receiving the email) and the time our email is viewed. This information helps us to make similar evaluations about our Websites and emails as with cookies and to determine the most desired features and information so that we can provide those features and information to you and personalize our interactions with you. This information may also be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
In addition, our communications to you may include "click-through URLs" linked to particular pages on one of our Websites. By clicking on one of the URLs, you will automatically enter one of our Websites and we may collect information related to the "click-through". We may use cookies to associate information in the click-through with your previous experiences on our Websites/Apps. You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on the URL links in our email communications.

If you electronically send us information about your interest in being a model for us (such as your name, size stats, work information, contact information, photographs and video), we will only use that information to determine whether we are interested in you being an Abercrombie & Fitch model and to contact you about prospective modeling. We may share also that information with our modeling agency. The modeling agency will use your information solely to assist us in determining whether we are interested in you being an Abercrombie & Fitch model.
