<h5>21. Governing Law and Forum for Disputes</h5>

<p>California state law governs this Agreement without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.</p>

<p>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS OF USE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision; the arbitrator shall apply California law to all other matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND INTUIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR LITIGATE ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</p>

<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Intuit Inc., in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules, but if you are unable to pay any of them, we will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such fees and costs for claims totaling less than $75,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Section 21 shall survive expiration, termination or rescission of this Agreement.</p>

Each time you add an account through your use of the Bill Payment Service, you will be directly connected to the website for the third party you have identified. Once you have added an account through your use of the Bill Payment Service, Mint Bills will submit information, including usernames and passwords that you provide, to log you into the third party site (each, a "Third Party Site"). You hereby authorize and permit Mint Bills to use and store your Bill Payment Account Information to accomplish the foregoing and to configure the Bill Payment Service so that they are compatible with the Third Party Sites for which you submit your Bill Payment Account Information.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Description of Fees</span>. Any fees applicable to your use of a Bill Payment Service will be charged regardless of whether or how often you use the Bill Payment Service during each period for which you have subscribed to the applicable Bill Payment Service. There may be charges for additional transactions and other optional services that you elect to use. You agree to pay fees for the all Bill Payment Service you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Payee Information; Authority</span>. By initiating a payment through the Bill Payment Service, you authorize Mint Bills to charge the account that you designate as the account to which the bill payments should be charged or withdrawn from (the "Funding Account"). You agree to maintain a balance or available credit limit in the specified Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate. You represent and warrant that you have the right to authorize Mint Bills to charge the Funding Account for payments you initiate using the Bill Payment Service. You will indemnify and hold Intuit harmless from any claims by any other owner of the account

Such communication may include messages, including text messages, to the recipient of the Bill Payment Service to receive money you had paid them using the Bill Payment Service. You agree to inform Mint Bills if a person withdraws his consent to receiving text messages from you.</p>

	<p>Mint Bills does not charge a fee to send a text message when using the Bill Pay Service. However, any text messages sent and/or received are subject to standard text message rates depending on the recipient’s carrier and terms and conditions with the carrier. To stop receiving messages, reply STOP to any text messages you receive from us.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="underline">Limits On Payees, Payment Amounts And Methods</span>. You acknowledge that certain Payees may not accept payment from all types of funding sources and that we may otherwise limit the payment methods available for a particular Payee. For example, you may not be permitted to use a credit card to make a mortgage payment. Additionally, Mint Bills may, at its discretion, impose limits on the number and amount of payments, in aggregate, that you can send using the Bill Payment Service.</p>

	<p>Mint Bills may refuse to permit payment to any Payee if we reasonably believe such refusal is necessary or advisable for legal or security reasons. If you fail to maintain a balance in the applicable Funding Account that is insufficient to fund any payment that you initiate, Mint Bills may refuse to make any subsequent payment for as long as we determine to be necessary or appropriate. Mint Bills also reserve the right to refuse to make any other payment.</p>

	<p>Mint Bills will make payments you request through the Bill Payment Service either electronically, by charging your designated credit card or via other form of funds transfer that Mint Bills may choose to employ. Payments to Payees outside of the United States or its territories are prohibited through the Bill Payment Service. The Bill Payment Service does not support payment to all types of billers, including certain government agencies and bills such as tax payments and court-ordered payments.</p>
	</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Rejected Payments</span>. When you send a payment via the Bill Payment Service, the Payee is not required to accept it. You agree that you will not hold Mint Bills liable for any damages resulting from a Payee not receiving payment made through the Bill Payment Service for any reason. If payment is not accepted for any reason, Mint Bills will void the payment and credit the applicable Funding Account.</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="underline">Inability to Access Funds from Funding Account</span>. In using the Bill Payment Services, you are requesting Mint Bills to facilitate making payments from your Funding Account(s) to your Payee(s). If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account to complete a bill payment transaction you request for any reason (for example, non-sufficient funds, closed account, inability to locate account, or reversal by you and/or your bank), the transaction may not be completed. If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account for any reason, you agree that:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>you will reimburse Mint Bills immediately, upon demand, the transaction amount to the extent that Mint Bills sent a payment to the Payee on your behalf;</li>
		<li>you will reimburse Mint Bills for any fees imposed on us as a result of the transaction; and</li>
		<li>you will reimburse the Bill Payment Services for any fees, including reasonable attorney fees, we incur in attempting to collect the amount of the transaction from you.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Additionally, you agree that Mint Bills may: (a) reverse any corresponding credit or direct deposits issued to you; (b) reverse any payments Mint Bills made to your Payee; (c) apply any money currently held by Mint Bills to any amount owed to us; (d) initiate electronic fund transfer from your account to collect any unpaid amounts and our fees.</p>

	<p>Mint Bills is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or available credit in the Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate.</p>

	<p>If Mint Bills is not able to recover all amounts owed to us, we may report this information to third parties, including consumer reporting agencies, financial institutions. Mint Bills reserves all rights to pursue all available legal remedies to recover all owed amounts.</p>

	<p>Any fees applicable to your use of the Bill Payment Services will be charged regardless of whether or not or how often you use the Bill Payment Services during each period for which you have subscribed to the applicable Service. There may be charges for additional transactions and other optional services that you elect to use. You agree to pay fees for the all Bill Payment Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="underline">Your Liability</span>. You are solely liable for errors you make in using the Bill Payment Service, including the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>you direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to a Payee from the wrong Funding Account;</li>
		<li>you erroneously direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to a Payee multiple times;</li>
		<li>you direct Mint Bills to submit the wrong amount to a Payee;</li>
		<li>you direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to the wrong Payee; or</li>
		<li>you change your mind about making a payment to a Payee after directing Mint Bills to submit the payment.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You are responsible for all fees, fines, penalties, and other liability incurred by Mint Bills, a Payee, you or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this Agreement and/or your use of the Bill Payment Service. You agree to reimburse Mint Bills, a Payee or the applicable third party for any and all such liability.</p>

	<p>In the event that you are liable for any amounts owed to Mint Bills for a payment you authorized through the Bill Payment Service, Mint Bills may immediately remove such amounts from or charge such amounts to your applicable Funding Account. If the applicable Funding Account does not have funds or available credit sufficient to cover your liability, you will be required to immediately add funds to the Funding Account or otherwise provide payment to Mint Bills through other means. If you do not do so, Mint Bills may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.</p>

	<p>Mint Bills does not have control of, or liability for, the products or services that are paid for via the Bill Payment Service.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="underline">Delays, Unauthorized Transactions, or Errors</span></p>

	<ol type="i">
		<li>
		<p><strong>Payment Processing Delays and Protection for Late Fees.</strong> You acknowledge that some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account with the applicable Payee due to circumstances beyond Mint Bills' control, such as delays in handling and posting payments by Payees or financial institutions or errors with account information or funding instructions.</p>

		<p>When you send a payment to certain Payees, the payment may be treated as an authorization to the Payee to process your payment and complete the transaction. Some Payees may delay processing your payment, in which case the payment may be held as pending until the Payee processes your payment and your payment authorization will remain valid for up to 30 days.</p>

		<p>To help ensure that there is enough time for the applicable Payee to receive any payments you submit through the Bill Payment Service, you should submit payment instructions at least 6 business days prior to the due date for the applicable bill. If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, you must submit the payment sufficiently in advance to include an additional day for processing. It is solely your responsibility to submit payments so they arrive by the Payee's due date.</p>

		<p>Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Mint Bills will bear responsibility for any satisfactorily documented late payment related charges up to a reasonable amount, not to exceed $50.00 in the event a payment posts after its due date provided that the payment was submitted by you for payment in accordance with the guidelines specified in the beginning of this paragraph and the Bill Payment Service issued you a confirmation number for a payment, unless we are not responsible to you for one of the reasons listed in this section or below under "Protection for Mint Bills Errors." THIS IS MINT BILLS ONLY OBLIGATION TO YOU FOR ANY PAYMENT ERRORS, DELAYS, OR FAILURE. IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE RULES OR IF YOU DO NOT ALLOW ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE A PAYMENT, YOU ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PENALTIES OR LATE CHARGES ON THAT PAYMENT.</p>

		<p>Any fees applicable to your use of a Service will be charged regardless of whether or how often you use the Services during each period for which you have subscribed to the applicable Service. There may be charges for additional transactions and other optional services that you elect to use. You agree to pay fees for the all Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Errors or other Issues Regarding Payments.</strong> It is your responsibility to review all payment transactions initiated in the Bill Payment Service against account statements you receive from your bank or other financial institution. Your payment transaction information is included in the receipts we provide you. ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH THE BILL PAYMENT SERVICE MUST BE DIRECTED TO MINT BILLS, AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT. We will work with you and your biller (as appropriate) to resolve errors that we caused.</p>

		<p>We may not send you a periodic statement listing transactions that you make using the Bill Payment Service. The transactions will appear only on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Protection for Mint Bills Errors.</strong> Mint Bills will use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the payment of your bills in accordance with this Agreement. However, Mint Bills will not be liable, for instance:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>if, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer;</li>
			<li>the payment is rejected, returned, mishandled, or delayed by the Payee for any reason;</li>
			<li>you have provided Mint Bills with incorrect information about the Payee;</li>
			<li>the Funding Account you specify as the payment source is closed or does not contain sufficient funds to complete the payment or the charge is rejected or returned by your bank or financial institution;</li>
			<li>due to any pre-announced unavailability of the Bill Payment Service;</li>
			<li>due to fraud or attacks on our systems, service or the Bill Payment Service;</li>
			<li>due to third party service providers; or</li>
			<li>due to circumstances beyond our control (for example, fire, flood, interference from an outside source, postal delays, or any failure by your computer, software, or Internet connection).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Unauthorized Transactions.</strong> You must notify Mint Bills immediately if you suspect or believe that a transaction has occurred through the Bill Payment Service that you did not authorize or that you believe an incorrect amount was authorized. You may contact us using the contact methods specified in section 5 of Article I (General Terms) above. If you initially provide information to us via the telephone, we may require that you send your complaint or question in writing. You will be asked and are required to provide us with the following information: your name; the email address registered for the Bill Payment Service account; a description (including dollar amount) of the transaction that you believe is unauthorized or in error; and a Mint Bills reference/transaction ID; and explanation to why you believe there was unauthorized transaction or error. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you an explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>

		<p>For unauthorized transfers and errors with respect to your credit card or debit card that are not related to the Bill Payment Service, please see your applicable card holder agreement.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="underline">Risk Monitoring; Unusual or Suspicious Transactions</span>. In an effort to manage our risk, we may monitor your transactions and processing activity for high-risk practices or for fraudulent transactions. We may also engage third-party service providers to assist in these efforts and other elements of the Bill Payment Service. If Mint Bills believes there is suspicious or unusual activity, Mint Bills may temporarily suspend your access to Bill Payment Service. Suspicious or unusual activity includes, but is not limited to changes in your average transaction amount or processing pattern or use of different payment accounts. Mint Bills may require additional documentation to promptly reinstate your access to the Bill Payment Service.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="underline">Termination</span>. Mint Bills may terminate or suspend your access to the Bill Payment Service at any time. Neither termination nor suspension shall affect your liability or obligations under this Agreement. In the event you or Mint Bills terminates your account, any payment(s) Mint Bills has already processed before the requested termination date may be completed. You should verify payment directly with your intended payee. Mint Bills is not responsible for any payments not completed by us as a result of termination.</p>

<h5>26. Bill Processing Services</h5>

<ol type="A">
	<li><span class="underline">Description of Service; Disclaimer</span>.

Mint Bills is not a party to these payments or to their underlying commercial transactions, and Mint Bills disclaims any and all responsibility for any payments or other disputes between Billers and Payers. Such disputes are entirely between the Billers and their Payers. Mint Bills is the payment processor for the Billers.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Registration</span>. Each Biller must register with Mint Bills and accept this Agreement. Mint Bills will collect information from Billers to enable us to verify your identities and satisfy ourselves that it is appropriate for Mint Bills to process your payment transactions in accordance with our legal obligations under such laws as "know your customer" and OFAC. Mint Bills reserves the right to decline to accept a Biller into our Biller Processing Service, or to suspend or terminate our processing for any Biller at any time, or to suspend or terminate our Biller Processing Service entirely at any time and at our sole discretion.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Additional Agreements</span>. If required by an automated clearing house association (ACH), another processor or one of our banks, a Biller may have to enter into additional agreements. If you are unwilling to do so if requested, we may suspend or terminate your access to our Biller Processing Service.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Bill Processing Method</span>. Mint Bills will process payments for Billers by (i) facilitating ACH debit entries or other methods to withdraw funds from our users' funding accounts, (ii) receiving these funds on your behalf, (iii) deducting our bill payment processing fee; and (iv) remitting the balance to you. You hereby authorize Mint Bills to process bill payments for you in accordance with our Terms of Use and to make payments to you by paper draft or electronic funds transfer as long as you are a participant in our Biller Processing Service.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Termination by You</span>. You may at any time instruct us to discontinue our Biller Processing Service for you by logging into your processor account and following the instructions provided. Your instructions will become effective in five (5) business days or such longer period as shall be commercially reasonable under the circumstances for us, our processors and banks to act on your instructions.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Payments Received on Your Behalf; Release of Payer</span>. Payments under this program will be originated by any one of your Payers (our users) directing us, as your bill payment processor, to facilitate the withdrawal of funds from a Payer account to satisfy a bill payment or other debt the Payer owes to you. When Mint Bills, as your bill payment processor, receive a payment from a Payer on your behalf, you expressly agree that you have received that payment from the Payer, and as of that time, you fully release that Payer from any obligation the Payer had to you for payment in that amount. You agree that you will not thereafter attempt to collect on such obligation and will treat it as conclusively discharged.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Certain Limitations on Transactions</span>. Mint Bills provide our Biller Processing Service only for U.S. dollar payments made from Payers in the United States to Billers located in the United States who are engaged solely in lawful activities. Payments must be for goods sold or services rendered by the Biller. You hereby represent that you understand and meet all the criteria in this section.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Our Rights in Cases of Fraud or Unlawful Activities</span>. If we believe a requested payment to you may have arisen from fraud or unlawful activity or that its completion may harm us or any of our users, processors or banks, we may refuse to process that transaction or, if processed, refuse to remit such funds to you. If such a transaction has already been remitted to you, you authorize us to debit the transaction amount from your bank account within 90 days of the date the transaction was initiated. You expressly authorize us to share with law enforcement agencies any information relating to your business or our transactions with you. We may ask you for additional information about your business and transactions with us at any time, and you agree to provide it.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Settlement</span>. In the normal course, we will endeavor to make an electronic funds transfer to a designated bank account of yours within two to four business days after we receive payment on your behalf from one of your Payers. We may, at our sole discretion, accelerate these payments to you, but we also reserve the right to delay or withhold payments to you in accordance with the provisions of our Terms of Use.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Transaction Confirmation and Error Reporting</span>. When we make a payment to you, we will post a payment confirmation that you can view securely on our website. You are responsible for regularly monitoring information regarding the transactions we process for you. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, you are responsible for compiling, reconciling and retaining such information. If you believe there is an error in a transaction we have posted or that you have not received confirmation of a payment, you agree to bring this to our attention in writing through our website immediately.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Correction of Errors</span>. We will attempt to rectify processing errors we discover. If we determine we have paid you less than you were entitled to receive, we will send you an appropriate amount. If an error has resulted in your receiving more than you were entitled to, you agree to promptly refund the excess. You agree that we may set off any amount you owe us from future payments due to you. Failure to properly notify us within 60 days of an error first appearing in a payment confirmation we have made available to you will be deemed a waiver of any rights you may have regarding such error.</li>
