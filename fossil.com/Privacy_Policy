<h4>PRIVACY POLICY AND LEGAL NOTICE</h4>
<h4>UPDATED: 9/28/2012</h4>

<div class="ccColumn1">
<p>
Because Fossil values your patronage and respects your privacy rights, we are voluntarily providing you with this statement of our Privacy Policy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for fossil.com, and any site from which you access this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Website").
</p>
<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h4>
<p>
"Personal Information" is information through which you can be identified. The Personal Information that Fossil collects includes Personal Information collected in any Fossil stores. The Fossil website, any Fossil mobile application or through any service provider. The Personal Information that Fossil collects depends on the nature of your activities, including, but not limited to, whether youmake a purchase or order, make a return, make an exchange, complete a survey, <a href="/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ContactUsView?langId=-1&storeId=12052&catalogId=25005&page=contactus&nav=custCareNav" target="_blank">contact us for information</a>, communicate online with a customer service representative, opt-in to receive our emails, register for a promotion, join a forum, join our social networking sites, download software, <a href="/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?langId=-1&storeId=12052&catalogId=25005" target="_blank">create an account</a> on the Website, write a review, create a wish list, request a catalog and proceed through the checkout process on the Website. Personal Information that Fossil may collect from you may include your name, address, email address, your employer, phone number, your login and password, order information, credit card information, and comments that may identify you, and other information. If you use our "share" functionality found on our product pages, or the "send to a friend" functionality on our promotion pages, or if you otherwise choose to send an email from our site to a friend, we will also collect your friend's name and email address. The information on your friend that you provided to us is only used to send the forwarding email and is not saved in our customer or marketing databases.
</p>
<h4>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
<p>
Fossil uses Your Personal Information to identify you to respond to your online email requests, to register you for certain activities/access on the Website at your request and to confirm that registration, to help identify you in the event you lose your password, to process your entry warranty and repair requests, to respond to customer service requests, to process returns and exchanges, to process personal shopper requests, to process catalog requests, to process email marketing requests, to process product reviews, to process your entry into sweepstakes or promotions, to provide you with free gifts and other promotional offers, to combine the Personal Information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross reference with our marketing partners and others, and to otherwise maximize your access to our services and products, and order processing/fulfillment. With respect to use of the Website, without transmitting your Personal Information, you can still use most of our Website, however, you will not be able to send us email inquiries, access certain features/sections, complete a survey, register online for giveaways, request a catalog, request email marketing notifications, obtain on-line customer service, write product reviews, create wish lists or make an online purchase.
</p>
<p>
In furtherance of the foregoing uses, your Personal Information may also be shared with Fossil's employees, agents, representatives, and selected third party service providers (as set forth further below) who will be under an obligation to Fossil to use reasonable care to keep this information confidential and are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than in connection with the service they provide to us.
</p>
<p>
Fossil may hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps facilitate our direct marketing communications. In those instances, there is a need to share your Personal Information with these contracted companies. Your opt-out choices below will not apply to sharing of your information by Fossil with any of these companies. Note: all contracted companies are contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality and security of all Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally we may also share your Personal Information with select third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services ("promotional purposes") offered by them. We may also share your Personal Information with organizations that represent multiple third parties who either may send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by those third parties or share your Personal Information with those third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. We may also occasionally share your Personal Information with organizations that combine the Personal Information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and other third parties. We use that combined information to enhance your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products, to inform you of events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. We also may share that combined information with third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. When sharing your information for promotional purposes, Fossil attempts to select reputable companies that offer high quality products and services. When we share your Personal Information with a third party, your Personal Information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your Personal Information. You may choose to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties as described below.
</p>
<p>
In the event that you enter into a sweepstakes or other giveaway, your Personal Information may be shared according to the rules of that particular sweepstakes, giveaway or promotion. Any personal information that you include in the text of a product review may be made public in the product review section of the website. The information contained in your wish list may be shared with the friends and family that you insturct us to share it with.
</p>
<p>
Fossil reserves the right to transfer your Personal Information to a third party in the event of a transfer of all or substantially all of Fossil's assets to a third party, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to terms similar to those of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>Fossil may also disclose Personal Information:
<ol>
<li>to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process;</li>
<li>to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities;</li>
<li>to protect and defend Fossil, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute;</li>
<li>to enforce the <a href="/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ContentView?storeId=12052&page=customerCare_termsofuse&nav=leftNav_CustomerCare&catalogId=25005&langId=-1">Terms of Use of our Website</a>; and</li>
<li>to prevent imminent physical harm.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Generally, you may not opt-out of service related communications, which are not promotional in nature. Nor will your opt-out choices apply to sharing by Fossil of your Personal Information with the service providers used by Fossil to enhance your experience on the Website and/or to allow Fossil to provide you with more personalized promotional materials, as set forth in this Privacy Policy. However, you can opt-out of direct promotional communications from Fossil, or the sharing of Personal Information with third parties for the purpose of promotional communications, by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication or emailing <a href="mailto:fossil@fossil.com">fossil@fossil.com</a> or calling 866-268-1502.

<p>
Personal Information submitted or collected may be stored and/or processed in the United States for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. By using Fossil's products and services (including this Website), you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
</p>
<h4>GENERAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE</h4>
<p>
"General Information" is information we collect through your connection and interaction with our Website. General Information does not identify you, personally - for instance, we can't identify your name or address from your Internet browser address, but we can use General Information to compile statistics about visitors to our Website and preferences of our visitors. General Information we collect when you visit our Website includes the domain and host from which you access the Internet (ex: aol.com), the Internet protocol address ("IP Address") of the computer you are using (this is the number used by computers on a network to identify them to other computers), the browser software you are using, the operating system you are using, the date and time that you access our Website, the specific pages you visit at our Website, the number of visits you make to our Website, the number of visits to specific pages you make at our Website, and products or services viewed at our Website.
</p>
<p>
We use the General Information we collect to perfect and administer our Website, analyze trends, and generate aggregate statistics about visitors to our Website. In situations where it is possible to do so, General Information may be linked to Personal Information. Further, Fossil may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable General Information, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing the information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon our right to aggregate or de-personalize your Personal Information, and we may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable General Information in any way.
</p>

Please also include your name and all of the postal addresses and email addresses that you have provided to us.
</p>
<h4>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</h4>
<p>
A cookie is an element of data that frequently contains an anonymous unique identifier. Such data is sent from the website to your browser, which may then store it on your system for future use. Our Website uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to honor your preferences, such as not using frames.
</p>
<p>
Web beacons are clear image files that may be placed on a website to monitor the behavior of visiting users of the website. Web beacons are used in conjunction with cookies and assist in passing along the same type of General Information, such as the IP address, time, and duration that a web page was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the image, and previously set cookie values.
</p>
<p>
Our Website collects information through a variety of technical methods, including cookies and web beacons. These methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may use the information collected through these technical methods for many purposes, including delivering content, tracking or enhancing your experience on our Website. We may also use technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Website or third party websites, such as the frequency with which you visit certain parts of the Website or third party websites. In HTML e-mails that we send you, we may use technical methods for a number of purposes, including: to determine whether you have opened or forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails, to customize the display of banner advertisements, and to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular e-mail. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.
</p>
<p>
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to accept or reject it. You may not be able to conduct some transactions or use some services on our Website if you disable your browser from accepting cookies.
</p>
<h4>CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT ("COPPA")</h4>
<p>
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from our Website about children under the age of 13. We request that persons under the age of 13 not use our Website without supervision from a responsible adult. We will never request Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has sent Personal Information to us without prior parental consent, we will remove his or her Personal Information from our files.
</p>
<h4>SECURITY</h4>
<p>
Fossil has implemented a variety of security measures to prevent the unauthorized release of, access to, or use of Personal Information collected through our Website. For example, we store your Personal Information on computer servers that are located in controlled facilities and that have limited access. We have set up technical security measures such as browser encryption, routers and firewalls to safeguard Personal Information against unauthorized access. Our servers are located in the United States. Please be advised, however, that no security system is impenetrable/fail-proof. The secure servers are not generally accessible by unauthorized third parties, but could become accessible in the event of a security breach. Fossil has no control over the security of computers or other electronic devices of others or over means you use to send emails and submit information to Fossil over the Internet. Therefore, Fossil cannot ensure safety regarding the disclosure or interception of your information before it is received by Fossil.
</p>
<h4>LINKS TO OTHER MATERIALS</h4>
<p>
If any link is offered connecting to a third-party website, it is for the convenience of our Website visitors and as an accommodation to the respective third-party site owner and without charge. Fossil reserves the right to reject any request for a link to a third-party website and to remove any link for any reason. Sites linked to and from this Website are not necessarily under the control of Fossil and Fossil shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. If you click on an advertisement or link on the Website and link to a third party's website, then this Privacy Policy will not apply to your personally identifiable information collected on that third party's website and you must read the privacy policy on that website to see how your information will be handled.
</p>
<h4 id="optOut">OPT OUT PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>
With regard to Personal Information that you have provided or that has been collected under this Privacy Policy, you may opt out of uses of that information that are promotional in nature, such as correspondence from us about our products and promotions or the sharing by us of your Personal Information with select third parties for promotional purposes. There are several methods by which you can exercise your opt-out/do not share preferences with respect to email communications from Fossil for promotional purposes: (a) during registration on the Website; (b) after registration, by logging into your account on the Website and following the opt-out directions; and (c) by following the directions provided in an email to you. Information regarding opt-out and "do not share" procedures is provided in every promotional email we send to you.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to unsubscribe from our mailing list please email <a href="mailto:fossil@fossil.com">fossil@fossil.com</a> or call 866-268-1502. If you would like to ensure that your information is not shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, email <a href="mailto:fossil@fossil.com">fossil@fossil.com</a> or call 866-268-1502. In either case you must provide your all names and addresses you may have provided to Fossil to ensure that they are all removed.

</p>
<p>
Each of the opt-out and "do not share" procedures and choices are subject to the exceptions described in this Privacy Policy.

</p>
<p>
If you do not exercise your opt-out or "do not share" choices upon registration on the Website, it may take up to ninety (90) days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective.

</p>
<h4>ONWARD TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>
We may share Personal Information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf.

Fossil provides Customers and Employees with reasonable access to the Personal Information maintained about them. We also provide a reasonable opportunity, as required by applicable law, to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate.

Employees should submit requests for access to their Personal Information to their local Human Resources representative.
