		U.S.A.
This website ("Website") and associated websites are maintained by:
The publisher of this Website ("Publisher") collects personally identifying information and data about individuals, their company, and their company's demographics (personally identifying information and data) including (i) when you provide information to us, such as when you register or sign up for any of our products such as publications, subscriptions, e-mails, contests, newsletters, memberships, RSS Feeds, webcasts, White Papers, online seminars, conferences and other communications with the Publisher, (ii) when you register or sign up on one of our Websites, or when you register for any other IDG Publishing Network products individually or through auto register, your information will be known to the Publisher and (iii) from time to time we may add other information that we collect from third party sources to enhance the information that you provided to the Publisher.
Below is the current policy regarding the usage of personally identifying information and data collected by the Publisher. We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis based on feedback from readers. The Publisher reserves the right to change its privacy policy. However, if there are any changes to the use of personally identifying information and data that is different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you by posting a notice on our Website.
The Publisher or one of our IDG affiliated companies, or third party partners or advertisers may place online tracking technology such as a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, except when such information has been supplied by a subscriber or registered user. In addition, cookies placed in the browser files of a user's computer by a third party advertiser, may be used by the advertiser to collect web viewing data to serve further online interest-based advertising, also known as online behavioral advertising. 
If you have registered with our Website, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our Website.
	If you haven't registered with our Website, we may place a cookie on your system to help provide a more personalized experience. This cookie identifies you as a unique user by means of a tracking ID. However, if you have not registered on our Website, we cannot link that user ID with personally identifying information and data about you such as your name or e-mail address.
Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable the Publisher to manage the banner advertisements presented or personalized information to the user.
Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or, you can use third-party "anonymizer" services to mask information in your cookies, or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered by the Publisher site(s).
The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:

to improve the content and design of  our Website
to enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to our Website
to help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of our Website for their ad campaigns
as clear GIFs, also known as pixel tags, provided by our ad-serving company to help manage online advertising. These clear GIFS let our ad-serving company recognize a browser's cookie when a user visits our site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable (It does not include your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address). For more information about our ad-serving company or for your choices about not having this anonymous information used, please visit http://www.google.com/doubleclick/.
The Publisher has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on our Website itself and through its e-mail newsletters and other products. When DoubleClick is serving ads, it recognizes certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a user's IP address, browser version or type, operating system, service provider and time zone. DoubleClick also uses cookies to note the general content of the sites that users visit over time in order to serve ads on this site and other sites. Any pages a user calls up on our Website aren't connected with personally identifiable information collected either on our Website or elsewhere. For more details about the non-personally identifiable information DoubleClick collects and the opportunity to opt out of such data collection, please visit http://www.google.com/doubleclick/. We use web metric vendors to gather information to help us understand how users utilize our Website and other electronic products.
We may create and use aggregate customer data to understand more about the interests of our customers and may use the data to offer goods and services we believe may be of interest to our customers, on behalf of the Publisher, its sister IDG companies, or select organizations.

Postal addresses, and other personally identifying information and data may be collected from our online users (and, as applicable, our print subscribers) and may be used to promote the Publisher's and other IDG companies' products and services, and may be rented and/or licensed to select outside firms for promotional purposes. Offers for which the personally identifying information and data are rented and/or licensed for use and the users are required to target their offers carefully. 
Telephone numbers may be collected from our online users (and, as applicable, our print subscribers) and may be used by the Publisher to collect re-qualification data, and may be used by the Publisher, IDG and other IDG companies, affiliates and its advertisers for promotional purposes. The Publisher may rent and/or license for use phone numbers to select outside firms for promotional purposes. Offers for which the numbers are rented and/or licensed for use are required to target their offers carefully.
Mobile telephone numbers that are provided to the Publisher will be used to provide the products and services you've specifically requested, such as, but not limited to content delivery via sms text or other technologies, and for customer service related to the products and services you've requested. With your express consent, your mobile telephone number may be used to promote other products and services of the Publisher, as well as the products and services of other IDG companies. Further, your mobile phone number may, with your express consent, be used to promote the products and services of carefully chosen third parties. At any time you may "opt-out" of receiving communications via your mobile phone from the Publisher, other IDG companies, and third parties, by visiting networkworld.com or by clicking the unsubscribe link of any individual message you may receive. Because many phone companies recycle phone numbers, it is possible for users who purchase a new phone to receive messages that the previous owner had subscribed to or otherwise consented to receive.

Except as set forth in this policy no fax numbers are rented and/or licensed to outside firms.

These e-mail addresses may also be used to collect feedback by members of our editorial or research team, to promote the Publisher's and IDG products and services, and they may be rented to select outside firms* and/or licensed for promotional purposes. When you provide your email address to us, you agree to receive email from outside firms, the Publisher and its sister IDG companies, and the IDG Network. With each e-mail use of the user's address you can individually opt-out of receiving further e-mail from outside firms, the Publisher, its sister IDG companies and the IDG Network. Offers for which the e-mail address is rented and/or licensed for use require the users to target their offers carefully.
(*If, however, you are a registered user and have indicated, either in response to a question asked during the registration process in place prior to the date this policy was last updated (see the date posted at the end of the policy), or otherwise, that you do not wish to allow your email address to be rented and/or licensed for use by outside firms, your email address will not be rented and/or licensed for use.)
