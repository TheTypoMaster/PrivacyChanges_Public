ideel Privacy Policy


        ideel is concerned about your privacy and your experience using our service. This privacy policy describes how we gather, store, and use information about you. This policy applies to the ideel Sales, the main ideel website (www.ideel.com), and all other sites that end in ideel.com. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at support@ideel.com.
    

        Please note that you may link through the ideel website to other third party websites. Such sites are not controlled by ideel, and this privacy policy does not apply to these third party sites. You should review the privacy policy of any website you visit online.
    
What information does ideel collect? 

        ideel collects data about you using a number of methods: (1) through your participation in our Sales; (2) on the ideel website and through our mobile applications; and (3) through marketing partners. We may collect data through other channels in the future, but for now, these are the primary ways through which we gather data.
    

        The data we gather about you can vary according to the method through which the data is gathered. When you participate in a Sale, we gather information associated with the telephone (this may be a mobile or land-line phone). If you successfully win an item from a Giveaway or purchase an item during another type of sale, we gather additional information to enable shipping and confirmation of the item and your eligibility. The information we gather, regardless of the channel through which it is gathered, may include your name, address, email, phone, demographic data, ideel usage data, connection data associated with your mobile devices or computer, and service provider data. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future and we may also combine non-personal data (such as ideel website usage) with personal information.
    

        ideel does not intentionally gather data from or about children. Minors are not permitted to participate in ideel Sales.
    
What are cookies, and how do we use them? 

        When you visit the ideel website or use our mobile applications, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons.

Cookie information may be linked to your personal information for all of the purposes described above.
    

        From time to time, ideel may allow other companies to deliver a cookie while you are on the ideel website or using our mobile applications. These cookies (third party cookies) will always be delivered on behalf of ideel. In some cases, these third party cookies will be used to collect website usage and traffic information. In other cases, they may be used to collect information relating to advertising and content that you see and actions that you take on the ideel site and on other websites that you visit, such as pages views and site navigation patterns.
