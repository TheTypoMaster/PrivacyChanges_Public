Policies and Legal



Policies and Legal

Price Match

Does Staples have a Price-Match Guarantee?
Yes, we do. If you find a lower price on a new identical item, just show us the lower price when you buy the item at Staples or within 14 days of your Staples purchase, and we will match the price or give you the difference.
Our full Price-Match Guarantee is available when you place an order, or is available by calling 800-333-3330. For an in-store price match, please see an associate at our customer service desk. This policy is subject to change without notice.
Which competitors will Staples price match?
Staples® retail stores will price match prices at competitors' brick-and-mortar retail stores and at staples.com®.
Staples.com will price match select competitors' Web sites as well as Staples retail stores. These select competitors are Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, Dell, HP, Office Depot, OfficeMax, Quill, Medical Arts Press, Reliable, Sam's Club, Walmart, W.B. Mason and Xerox. Items must be sold and shipped by one of these competitors.
Which items does Staples price match?
We price match almost everything we sell. The item must be identical, including model number, components and U.S. warranty. The item must be in stock and available for purchase at that price from an authorized U.S. reseller, whose authorization we reserve the right to verify. For wireless phones and other items with a service plan, only in-store purchases are eligible for price match. The plan, provider and other terms must be the same. Products and services purchased online at our mobile phone sales and service site are not eligible for price match.
Are there any items and services that aren't available for Price Match?
We don't price match to competitors' or our own local special events (e.g., grand opening, anniversary, clearance, timed sales or liquidation sales). We don't price match our Staples® EasyTechsm tech services; our third-party providers' products and services (e.g., custom printing) or items sold on auction sites; taxes; warranties; typographical errors; gift cards or merchandise credits.
How do Staples coupons and rebates contribute to the Staples Price Match?
All coupons and rebates (including Staples dollars off, reward redemption codes, gift checks, Easy Rebates® and mail-in rebates, and instant savings) are deducted from the price of the Staples product when calculating a price match.
When calculating a price match, we'll deduct any available Staples coupons and/or Staples Rebates (rewards, dollars off, instant savings, Easy Rebates and mail-in rebates) from the Staples price to arrive at a net price. For example, if you buy an item from us for $200, use $20 in Staples Rewards® and there is a $20 instant savings, the net price is $160. If another company's price is $160 or more, the price match will not be approved, as the Staples price is equivalent or better. Another example: If you buy an item from us for $159 and you have a coupon for $25 off a $100 order, as well as a $20 mail-in rebate, the net price is $114. If another company's price is $110, your price match savings would be $4.
What does “proration of coupons” mean?
Proration of coupons means that the dollars-off coupons (Staples coupons, rewards, gift checks) are proportionally deducted from the prices of items on an order.
What effect will the proration of coupons have on a price match?
The prorated discount from all coupons on the order will be used when calculating the Staples price. The application of coupons can mean a specific purchase won't qualify for price match. Similarly, a purchase that has a price match discount may no longer be eligible for a coupon if the adjusted order total no longer meets the coupon's minimum requirements.
Will Staples match a competitor's price for a product where the competitor also offers an instant rebate, mail-in rebate, gift check or gift card, or free or discounted item?
If a competitor offers a product that comes with an instant rebate, mail-in rebate, gift check/gift card or similar discounts, we will not take these discounts into account. If a competitor offers a product that comes with a free or discounted item, and Staples does not carry the free or discounted item, we will only match the price you pay at the point of purchase, and will not take the free or discounted item into account.
Are delivery charges included in the price match?
This depends on whether your staples.com® order will receive free shipping and whether the competitor's order offers free shipping.
If your staples.com order will receive free shipping, and the competitor's order will receive free shipping, we will price match the product without considering shipping charges. If your staples.com order will receive free shipping and the competitor order will not receive free shipping, we will include an appropriate shipping charge in the competitor's price before calculating the price match.
If your staples.com order does not receive free shipping, and the competitor's order offers free shipping, we will deduct the Staples shipping charge from the competitor's price, so that the Staples price match item total is the same as what the competitor is selling the product for.
Are quantities limited on price matched products?
We may limit the quantity we sell of the price matched item, particularly if the other company has set a limit. In addition, we reserve the right to limit quantities sold to a customer.



Returns Policy

What is your return policy?
If you're not 100% satisfied with your Staples® purchase, you can return it for any reason.
Your purchase must be returned in salable condition with the original packaging, including Universal Product Code (UPC), manuals, parts and your receipt or packing slip.

What can and cannot be returned?
Office Supplies
No matter when you made your purchase, you can return office supplies to us for a full refund, including Staples® brand office products.
Software
Unopened boxed software that we currently sell may be returned for a full refund at any time. Opened software can only be exchanged for the same title version. Downloadable software is not returnable or refundable.
Technology and Business Machines
Technology and business machines — such as computers, digital cameras, printers and tablets — may only be returned within 14 days of the date of receipt, including Staples® brand technology and business machine products.
AppleCare+
Customers who purchased an AppleCare+ Protection Plan at Staples may return to Staples to cancel AppleCare within 30 days to receive a full refund. Staples cannot cancel AppleCare+ for customers who purchased the AppleCare elsewhere. All requests to cancel AppleCare+ beyond 30 days must be directed to Apple to receive a pro-rated refund.
Furniture
Furniture, including Staples® brand furniture, may only be returned within 14 days of the date of receipt. Custom-ordered and custom-assembled furniture is only returnable if it's defective when you receive it.
Ink and Toner Cartridges
Unopened and unexpired ink or toner cartridges, currently carried in our U.S. stores, may be returned at any time for a full refund.
Prepaid Cards
Gift cards and phone cards are nonrefundable and nonreturnable. They are valid only at the retailer/service provider listed on the card. Prepaid cards cannot be redeemed for cash. Specific terms and conditions are included with each card.
Refund Policy
Your purchase must be returned in saleable condition with the original packaging, including Universal Product Code (UPC), manuals, parts, and your receipt or packing slip.

I no longer have my receipt. Can I still return something?
If you're returning your item to the same store at which you made the purchase, and you have the credit or debit card you used to make the purchase, we can look up your receipt.
If it was an online order, you can look it up in the My Orders section and reprint your receipt.
If you no longer have your receipt and we cannot locate your transaction information, your return is eligible only for an in-store credit for the lowest selling price within the previous 30 days in our U.S. stores. A valid government identification is required for all returns made without a receipt.
We carefully monitor returns, and in some cases, returns made without a receipt may be refused. Staples reserves the right to deny any return.
If you ordered through our catalog or staples.com®, you can also have us pick up your return — send us an email or call 800-333-3330. For delivered items, we'll refund your delivery charges if the item is defective.



Rebates

How do I redeem a rebate offer?
There are two ways to redeem a rebate offer:
Staples® Easy Rebates®
Now you can submit most rebates online — no clipping, no mailing, no hassles. Easy Rebates are available on products purchased in Staples stores, through our catalog and online at staples.com.
Look for Easy Rebate products every time you shop. They're identified by the phrase "Easy Rebate" in the product description. When you're ready to submit your Easy Rebate, go to www.stapleseasyrebates.com and enter the required information right online. You won't have to clip out UPC codes or mail in receipts. You'll even receive emails keeping you posted on your rebate status, with links to the Track Status page online. Best of all, you'll receive your rebate faster than ever — within 4 to 6 weeks.
Note: Certain products, including most software titles, are not eligible for online submission. Any products excluded from the online submission process will be advertised as qualifying for a "mail-in rebate" versus an "Easy Rebate."
Mail in Rebates
Mail-in rebates are easy to redeem too. You can find and print rebate forms, and even track the status of your mail-in rebates, at www.stapleseasyrebates.com.
Because many rebate offers require original sales receipts and rebate forms, it's important to make copies of both and keep them with your records. Should a problem arise with your rebate redemption, having these copies will make it easy for us to resolve the issue.
If you purchased a rebate item through our catalog or at staples.com and a receipt is required as Proof of Purchase, you should use the packing slip that was included in your order as your receipt.
If you have questions about your rebate, please call 877-266-6483 Monday through Friday 7:00 am to 12:00 am ET, Saturday 8:00 am to 12:00 am ET, and Sunday 10:00 am to 12:00 am ET.



Shipping & Delivery Policy

What is your delivery policy?
An estimated delivery date will be provided after your order is placed. These dates vary due to carrier shipping practices, delivery location and the items you order. Products may be delivered in separate shipments.
Delivery dates noted apply to orders placed by 5:00 pm local time (or 4:00 pm local time in stores and in limited locations across the country) and where credit approval and product availability are confirmed by 5:00 pm on the same business day that the order is placed. (Note: Business days are defined as Monday through Friday, except holidays.) Items shipped direct from the vendor may require an earlier order placement time. You will be notified of the estimated delivery date in a confirmation email. (Not available for in-store orders unless email address is submitted.)
Staples® catalog, Web site and U.S. retail businesses are operated within the contiguous United States for customers within the U.S. and therefore do not ship or bill to international addresses. (For more about shopping internationally, click here.) Staples delivers to street addresses (not P.O. Boxes or APO/FPO) in the contiguous United States only.
Certain Staples items originate directly from carefully selected vendors and manufacturers. In many instances, delivery personnel will deliver your order to your entrance. Other items are prestocked at warehouses around the country and delivered by a common carrier. For these items, a loading dock is needed. If one is not available, delivery personnel will bring your order to the tailgate of the truck; you will be responsible for unloading the items and bringing them into your building.
How do I get free delivery
Free delivery is available for all Staples Rewards® members, all orders placed on the in-store kiosk, and all online orders of $45 or more — excluding orders made at documents.staples.com, print.staples.com, staplespromotionalproducts.com, and third-party Web sites linked to staples.com®. You can also have your order delivered to one of our retail stores for no charge.
Does Staples deliver to “Mail Drop” locations?
A Mail Drop location is an address where a business or service accepts mail deliveries on behalf of a customer. Staples will deliver to Mail Drop locations such as a UPS® store (formerly Mail Boxes Etc.). However, Staples is unable to deliver to P.O. Boxes or APO/FPO addresses, which are military overseas mail drops.

What to Do if You Believe Someone Has Improperly Used Your Personal Data
If you believe that someone has improperly accessed or used your personally identifiable information supplied to Staples or has made purchases at Staples that you did not authorize, please contact us immediately.
Here are some additional things that you can do to protect yourself from identity theft if you think that your Personal Information has been compromised:

Review Your Account Statements. Carefully review your bank, credit card and other account statements every month to ensure that all of your account activity is valid. Report any questionable charges promptly and in writing to the card or account issuer.
Check Your Credit Report. Check your credit report periodically to ensure that all your information is correct. You can obtain a free credit report once per year by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling 877-322-8228. Carefully reviewing your credit report can help you spot problems and address them quickly. If you have any questions about your credit report or notice any inaccuracies, contact the relevant consumer reporting agency promptly at the telephone number listed on the report.

Fraud Alert. Consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. The fraud alert requests that creditors contact you before opening any new accounts or increasing credit limits on your existing accounts. You can place a fraud alert on your credit file by contacting one of the three consumer reporting agencies listed below. You need to contact only one of the three agencies; the one you contact is required by law to contact the other two. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and then will be able to order a credit report from each of the three agencies, free of charge. The fraud alert will remain in your credit file for at least 90 days.
