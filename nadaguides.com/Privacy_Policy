Privacy Policy
P3PNADAguides.com privacy policy adheres to the P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences) developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. P3P is designed to give Web users more control over the use of their personal information collected on web sites they visit. P3P will allow users to easily view the privacy practices of Web sites they are visiting; the user will know what personal information is being collected, for what purposes, and who else is viewing this information. P3P enhances user control by putting privacy policies where users can find them, in a form users can understand, and, most importantly, enables users to act on what they see. If you would like to read more about P3P please go to http://www.w3.org/P3P/.
CookiesNADAguides.com uses "cookies" throughout our Web site. A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. It is uniquely yours and can only be read by the Web site that gave it to you. The cookies issued by the NADAguides.com Web servers store no personal information. A cookie's purpose is to tell our Web site that you returned. How a cookie helps you is it saves you time when ordering products, request information or services. A cookie helps NADAguides.com remember who you are. If you never register or leave personal information with NADAguides.com, then NADAguides.com only knows that someone with your cookie has returned to the Web site. You are in charge of deciding whether we know anything about you. But the more you tell us about yourself, the more we can help you find information or products you want. If a visitor wishes to not utilize cookie technology, this feature may be disabled within the visitor's Web browser.

We cannot and do not guarantee that our systems, or your information, will be secure.
    In the unlikely event that National Appraisal Guides, Inc., one of its business units or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.

Privacy PoliciesNADAguides.com collects various user information depending on what area of our Website the user is visiting.

No personal identifiable information is collected. Additionally, we have a voluntary customer survey which collects demographic information from the user. We have broken down our site into 6 different sections which collect various user information; and created 6 unique privacy policies which explain what information is collected within each section. Each of the 6 policies are listed below.
