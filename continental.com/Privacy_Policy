How we use your information
General - applicable to all sources of information
We primarily use your information, including personal information, to provide our services to you and to fulfill your requests.  We may combine your information with other information that we have about you, that is publicly available and/or that we have obtained from third parties (either individually or in the aggregate).  We also may use your information for the following purposes:

For flight information/wireless services.  You may register for receipt of flight information and other wireless services by indicating your preference to receive this information by providing relevant information or by granting applicable permissions.  Wherever possible, information already provided will be used for the delivery of these services.  Participation in these services may be optional.

For marketing and advertising.  United may use your information, either individually, in the aggregate, and/or combined with demographic information that we maintain or collect from third parties for marketing and advertising purposes (via email, direct mail, web or other electronic advertising) and to send you news and newsletters.  Specifically, we may use the information that we collect about you to send you email or direct mail communications about offers, including those offered by United, its partners or other third parties, that might be of interest to you.  We may also use your information to determine appropriate advertising channels and venues and to place ads on such channels and venues, including placing advertising on social networking sites.
For surveys and promotions.  From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in a survey or promotion.  We use survey results for various purposes, including to enhance our services and sites and to develop improved promotions, and, if you provide your name, we may contact you to further discuss your comments.  Unless otherwise stated in the promotion or survey, we use the contact information that we collect through promotions for the purpose of notifying the winner.

We use your information to improve and maintain our sites and services, respond to user desires and preferences, for other research and analytical purposes, and for security purposes, including, but not limited to, protecting ourselves and users of our services.
As permitted by law.

In addition to the above, specific examples of how we use information derived from the following categories are described below.
MileagePlus®
We use information that we collect from our MileagePlus members to enroll you in MileagePlus; to provide mileage credit for program related purchases and activities, including but not limited to MileagePlus partners; to communicate with you on the status of your MileagePlus account; to notify you of any special promotions for which you might be eligible; to pre-fill certain data fields to eliminate the need for you to enter the same information multiple times; perform the requested services (e.g., booking); to process your transactions (including billing); to notify you about flight information (including but not limited to reservation confirmation, flight or seat changes, boarding time(s), and available ancillary services).
We may use your information for marketing purposes, including to send you email or direct mail offers on services or products that may be of interest to you.  You may control certain marketing practices through your MileagePlus account as described below.
Children
No information we collect from children known to be under the age of 13 is used for any marketing or promotional purposes by either us, our affiliates, third party sponsors or other third parties with whom we may share information. We use the information collected about children known to be under 13 only to provide services. We will give out personal information about children if required by law, for example to comply with a court order or subpoena, or to protect the safety and security of visitors and our sites.
Information collected from our mobile application(s)
In addition to the uses of your information described above, if you use our mobile applications, we may use your information to send you push notifications (after requesting  your permission to do so) to your mobile device such as updates on flights, gate changes and offers or other information  that may be of interest to you.
If you permit us to collect your geo-location information, then we may provide you with location-based tools such as airport/map views, city code search, locating United Clubs or parking spaces, or sending you travel notices specific to your location.  In addition, for certain of our mobile applications, if you are a MileagePlus member we may use geo-location tracking, subject to your granting United permission, to provide you with other services and information such as identifying nearby retailer locations and/or to present you with offers which may be of interest to you, to facilitate your services and/or purchases through the application and to tally your miles and credit your account.  Geo-location information may also be used to protect United's interests.
You may withdraw your permission or opt-out of geo-location tracking. Please consult your chosen mobile device manufacturer for information on setting your location tracking features.
We may promote our sites via internet advertising. If you click on such an advertisement, information such as your mobile device's phone number may be sent to the advertising network so that they and we may track the effectiveness of our advertising.  This information might also be used for frequency capping, estimating the number of unique users, debugging or security measures and protecting United's interests.  You may opt-out of collection of such information by uninstalling the mobile application(s). Once the mobile application(s) has been uninstalled, all information stored in the application will be deleted, including any preferences you previously set or enabled.

Disclosing your information
United may disclose your personal information to the following persons/entities as discussed below:

Affiliates. We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries. Our affiliates and subsidiaries may use your information for various purposes, including, to market their products and services to you.
Service Providers.  We may share your information with third parties that assist us and perform functions on our behalf. These entities may include technical support, website hosting, service/order fulfillment, customer service, and credit card processing, among others. In some cases such third party service providers, such as information technology and data processing vendors, data storage services, etc. may be located outside the United States and your personal information may be processed or stored in other countries.
Non-Affiliated Third Parties. We may also share your information with third parties as necessary to complete your transaction or fulfill your requests.  United may also share your information with third parties for marketing purposes including but not limited to the third party's own marketing or promotional purposes or other companies' marketing purposes in order for them to present you with offers on services or products that may be of interest to you.  We may share your information with contracted corporate customers as part of our management of agreements we have with them.
Marketing Partners. If we jointly offer a product or service with a different entity, we will share your information with that entity to assist in marketing and providing that product or service.   These entities may include, but are not limited to:  airlines, car rental agencies, hotels, and travel agencies.  We may also share your information with our partners for their own marketing purposes.
Aggregate Information. Aggregate information such as demographic information, domain names, other site traffic information, etc., may at times be shared with United partners or other third parties. Examples of aggregate information are X% of eligible tickets purchased are eTickets; X% of subscribers use a mobile application, etc.
Law enforcement / Legal processes / Other uses.  United may also disclose your information: if required to do so by law, court order, subpoena or other legal process; as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority; to protect the rights or property of United, its customers, its sites or site users; or when we believe in good faith that it is in the interests of aviation security or that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.  In certain circumstances, United's third party service providers may be required to disclose information to government or law enforcement authorities.  Security, health and customs and immigration laws in the U.S. and many other countries require all airlines, including United, to provide border control agencies or other governmental authorities with passenger data.  In order to comply with these laws we may disclose information about you and your travel arrangements to such authorities.
Business Transactions.  If United is acquired by or merges with another entity, if any of our assets are transferred to another entity, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information that we have collected from and about you to the other entity.


Use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies
We and our third party service providers collect information by using technologies and methodologies, such as "cookies", tags, web beacons or other similar technologies that enable tracking as you browse our sites.  We use these technologies to authenticate you as a user, remember your preferences for using the site, to present you with offers that may be of interest and to facilitate transactions such as flight searches and purchases.  We and our third party service providers also use these tools to analyze use of our sites and our services.  We may use this information in the aggregate or we may combine it with information that we have already collected about you.
Cookie.  "Cookies" are small bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser.  Web beacons or "pixel tags" are small strings of code placed on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring information.    Cookies and the other technologies discussed in this section allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your transactions and facilitate effective website administration.
Cookies help establish a user session and allow our server to correctly provide site users with the appropriate information, advertisements and services. We also use cookies to ensure you obtain the information you request, to authenticate your authority to access the site, and to track the usage of our websites in order to improve the site(s) according to our customers' needs. If you are a registered user on our site and you elect to have the site store your MileagePlus number, the cookie stored on your computer will contain your MileagePlus number.
If you do not want your information to be collected through cookies, you can change the preferences in your particular Internet browser.  Some website functionality may not function properly if your browser does not accept cookies.  Specifically, if you choose not to accept our cookies and are a registered user, you will not have access to your information on this site such as your user profile, itineraries, award travel, upgrades and MileagePlus summary information.  Although you cannot log into the site as a registered user if you disable our cookies, you can still purchase on the site by logging in as a "Guest".   Please consult your chosen Internet browser for instructions on how to change your cookie settings.
Local Storage Objects. We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "Website Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions to review and, if you desire, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your transactions and facilitate effective website administration.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We and our third party service providers may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our sites and services to, among other things, track the activities of visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about usage.  We and our third party service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to you to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

Targeted advertising
United uses third party companies and ad networks, including but not limited to DoubleClick and Google Analytics, to deliver advertisements on its sites and on third party sites.  United may use its cookies and web beacons when working with these companies to provide them information regarding your use of the site (whether individually or in the aggregate) to assist them in determining relevant advertising.  These companies also may use the information about your visit to provide you with information or offers about United or other third party products and services that may be of interest to you.
In addition, some third-party advertising technology used by United to deliver advertisements may use separate cookies. This technology may be delivered via visits to our website, email messages, or otherwise. Web beacons on some pages of our site, in conjunction with these advertising cookies and our other cookies, enable the third party advertising technology to better understand onsite activity in the aggregate, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site or other sites, and to learn which advertisements bring users to our site or otherwise take action.
Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy.
Third party ad networks may be members of either the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or About Ads-Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAI").  If they are members and you do not want to receive targeted advertisements from these third party ad networks you may opt-out.  Information as to member companies, the practices of such third party ad networks and your choices regarding having information used by these companies, including how to opt-out, can be found at either: http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp for NAI members or  http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for DAI members.   Information on how to opt-out of the use of your information by DoubleClick can be found at http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/ and how to opt-out of Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Opting out of one or more NAI or DAI members only means that those particular members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.  It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other non-United websites.  If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opt-out  pages, you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAI opt-out may no longer be active.

Your access to your information
If you are a MileagePlus member, you can create, view or update your MileagePlus® account by accessing it through the MileagePlus profile section on united.com or by calling 1-800-421-4655.  You may also have an opportunity to update information relevant to your use of our mobile application(s) through the app itself.

Protecting information collected
United maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.  When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites.  Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.
If a third party, including but not limited to a family member, friend, co-worker or corporate travel desk, seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction.   Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has your consent and authorization to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions, including any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests  changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude you have given them your consent to do so.  Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices.  If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.

Your role in protecting your information
To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not  share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or  password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information. You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them.  We do not have control over the security of your mobile device.  United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, including but not limited to reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third party initiated changes to the mobile device.   The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.

Opting out
A MileagePlus member can opt-out of receiving marketing or promotion related emails or direct mail   from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded. In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change.  Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt-out of that type of communication in the future. Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.

Other sites/digital channels
Our sites and our online services may contain links to third-party sites.  Any access to and use of such linked sites is not governed by this Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party sites.  We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party sites.

Contact us
If you have comments or questions about this Privacy Policy, please submit your inquiry to United Customer Service. . Please reference this Privacy Policy in those communications.

Legal effect and changes to the policy
As previously stated, this Privacy Policy is not a contract nor does it otherwise create any legal rights or obligations.  Rather, this Privacy Policy merely reflects guidelines setting forth United's intended business practices. By using any United Digital Channel, and/or by providing any information to United online or off-line, you consent to the collection and use of such information by United, its affiliates, partners, contractors and permitted agents as herein described and consistent with applicable laws. Also, United, in its discretion, may amend, interpret, modify, or withdraw any portion of this Privacy Policy and related business practices at any time by posting updated text on this site, and your continued use of our Digital Channels or off line outlets constitutes your consent to those changes.  A version of this Privacy Policy has been effective since October 15, 2002 and was last updated on August 13, 2015. This Privacy Policy supersedes previous privacy policies posted on united.com and coair.com.
