We also may use your information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>For flight information/wireless services.</strong>  You may register for receipt of flight information and other wireless services by indicating your preference to receive this information by providing relevant information or by granting applicable permissions.  Wherever possible, information already provided will be used for the delivery of these services.  Participation in these services may be optional.</li> 
<li><strong>To improve your user experience.</strong>  To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, offer customized location information, personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using our sites or services.</li>

Specifically, we may use the information that we collect about you to send you email or direct mail communications about offers, including those offered by United, its partners or other third parties, that might be of interest to you.  We may also use your information to determine appropriate advertising channels and venues and to place ads on such channels and venues, including placing advertising on social networking sites.</li>

<p>In addition to the above, specific examples of how we use information derived from the following categories are described below.</p>

<h3>MileagePlus&reg;</h3>

<p>We use information that we collect from our MileagePlus members to enroll you in MileagePlus; to provide mileage credit for program related purchases and activities, including but not limited to MileagePlus partners; to communicate with you on the status of your MileagePlus account; to notify you of any special promotions for which you might be eligible; to pre-fill certain data fields to eliminate the need for you to enter the same information multiple times; perform the requested services (e.g., booking); to process your transactions (including billing); to notify you about flight information (including but not limited to reservation confirmation, flight or seat changes, boarding time(s), and available ancillary services).</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>No information we collect from children known to be under the age of 13 is used for any marketing or promotional purposes by either us, our affiliates, third party sponsors or other third parties with whom we may share information. We use the information collected about children known to be under 13 only to provide services. We will give out personal information about children if required by law, for example to comply with a court order or subpoena, or to protect the safety and security of visitors and our sites.</p>

<h3>Information collected from our mobile application(s)</h3>

<p>In addition to the uses of your information described above, if you use our mobile applications, we may use your information to send you push notifications (after requesting  your permission to do so) to your mobile device such as updates on flights, gate changes and offers or other information  that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>If you permit us to collect your geo-location information, then we may provide you with location-based tools such as airport/map views, city code search, locating United Clubs or parking spaces, or sending you travel notices specific to your location.  In addition, for certain of our mobile applications, if you are a MileagePlus member we may use geo-location tracking, subject to your granting United permission, to provide you with other services and information such as identifying nearby retailer locations and/or to present you with offers which may be of interest to you, to facilitate your services and/or purchases through the application and to tally your miles and credit your account.  Geo-location information may also be used to protect United's interests.</p>

<p>You may withdraw your permission or opt-out of geo-location tracking. Please consult your chosen mobile device manufacturer for information on setting your location tracking features.</p>

<p>We may promote our sites via internet advertising. If you click on such an advertisement, information such as your mobile device's phone number may be sent to the advertising network so that they and we may track the effectiveness of our advertising.  This information might also be used for frequency capping, estimating the number of unique users, debugging or security measures and protecting United's interests.  You may opt-out of collection of such information by uninstalling the mobile application(s). Once the mobile application(s) has been uninstalled, all information stored in the application will be deleted, including any preferences you previously set or enabled.</p>

<a name="Disclosing_your_information"></a>
<h2>Disclosing your information</h2>

<p>United may disclose your personal information to the following persons/entities as discussed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries. Our affiliates and subsidiaries may use your information for various purposes, including, to market their products and services to you.</li> 
<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>  We may share your information with third parties that assist us and perform functions on our behalf. These entities may include technical support, website hosting, service/order fulfillment, customer service, and credit card processing, among others. In some cases such third party service providers, such as information technology and data processing vendors, data storage services, etc. may be located outside the United States and your personal information may be processed or stored in other countries.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Affiliated Third Parties.</strong> We may also share your information with third parties as necessary to complete your transaction or fulfill your requests.  United may also share your information with third parties for marketing purposes including but not limited to the third party's own marketing or promotional purposes or other companies' marketing purposes in order for them to present you with offers on services or products that may be of interest to you.  We may share your information with contracted corporate customers as part of our management of agreements we have with them.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing Partners.</strong> If we jointly offer a product or service with a different entity, we will share your information with that entity to assist in marketing and providing that product or service.   These entities may include, but are not limited to:  airlines, car rental agencies, hotels, and travel agencies.  We may also share your information with our partners for their own marketing purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregate Information.</strong> Aggregate information such as demographic information, domain names, other site traffic information, etc., may at times be shared with United partners or other third parties.

In certain circumstances, United's third party service providers may be required to disclose information to government or law enforcement authorities.  Security, health and customs and immigration laws in the U.S. and many other countries require all airlines, including United, to provide border control agencies or other governmental authorities with passenger data.  In order to comply with these laws we may disclose information about you and your travel arrangements to such authorities.</li>

<a name="Use_of_cookies"></a>
<h2>Use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies</h2>

<p>We and our third party service providers collect information by using technologies and methodologies, such as "cookies", tags, web beacons or other similar technologies that enable tracking as you browse our sites.  We use these technologies to authenticate you as a user, remember your preferences for using the site, to present you with offers that may be of interest and to facilitate transactions such as flight searches and purchases.  We and our third party service providers also use these tools to analyze use of our sites and our services.  We may use this information in the aggregate or we may combine it with information that we have already collected about you.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cookie.</em></strong>  "Cookies" are small bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser.  Web beacons or "pixel tags" are small strings of code placed on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring information.    Cookies and the other technologies discussed in this section allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your transactions and facilitate effective website administration.</p>

<p>Cookies help establish a user session and allow our server to correctly provide site users with the appropriate information, advertisements and services. We also use cookies to ensure you obtain the information you request, to authenticate your authority to access the site, and to track the usage of our websites in order to improve the site(s) according to our customers' needs. If you are a registered user on our site and you elect to have the site store your MileagePlus number, the cookie stored on your computer will contain your MileagePlus number.</p>

<p>If you do not want your information to be collected through cookies, you can change the preferences in your particular Internet browser.  Some website functionality may not function properly if your browser does not accept cookies.  Specifically, if you choose not to accept our cookies and are a registered user, you will not have access to your information on this site such as your user profile, itineraries, award travel, upgrades and MileagePlus summary information.  Although you cannot log into the site as a registered user if you disable our cookies, you can still purchase on the site by logging in as a "Guest".   Please consult your chosen Internet browser for instructions on how to change your cookie settings.</p>

<p><strong><em>Local Storage Objects.</em></strong> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.

<p><strong><em>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</em></strong> These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your transactions and facilitate effective website administration.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We and our third party service providers may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our sites and services to, among other things, track the activities of visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about usage.  We and our third party service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to you to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>

<a name="Targeted_advertising"></a>
<h2>Targeted advertising</h2>

<p>United uses third party companies and ad networks, including but not limited to DoubleClick and Google Analytics, to deliver advertisements on its sites and on third party sites.  United may use its cookies and web beacons when working with these companies to provide them information regarding your use of the site (whether individually or in the aggregate) to assist them in determining relevant advertising.  These companies also may use the information about your visit to provide you with information or offers about United or other third party products and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>In addition, some third-party advertising technology used by United to deliver advertisements may use separate cookies. This technology may be delivered via visits to our website, email messages, or otherwise. Web beacons on some pages of our site, in conjunction with these advertising cookies and our other cookies, enable the third party advertising technology to better understand onsite activity in the aggregate, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site or other sites, and to learn which advertisements bring users to our site or otherwise take action.</p>

<p>Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Third party ad networks may be members of either the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or About Ads-Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAI").  If they are members and you do not want to receive targeted advertisements from these third party ad networks you may opt-out.  Information as to member companies, the practices of such third party ad networks and your choices regarding having information used by these companies, including how to opt-out, can be found at either: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> for NAI members or  <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> for DAI members.   Information on how to opt-out of the use of your information by DoubleClick can be found at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a> and how to opt-out of Google Analytics at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p>Opting out of one or more NAI or DAI members only means that those particular members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.  It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other non-United websites.  If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opt-out  pages, you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAI opt-out may no longer be active.</p>

<h2>Protecting information collected</h2>

<p>United maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.

<p>If a third party, including but not limited to a family member, friend, co-worker or corporate travel desk, seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction.   Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has your consent and authorization to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions, including any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests  changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude you have given them your consent to do so.  Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices.  If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p>

<a name="Your_role_in_protecting_your_information"></a>
<h2>Your role in protecting your information</h2>

<p>To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not  share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or  password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information.

Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt-out of that type of communication in the future. Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.</p>
