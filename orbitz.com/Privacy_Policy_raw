	<li>
		To our insurers and to regulatory agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosure without Consent</strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please note that there are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted, or where Orbitz may be obligated to disclose information without consent.</span></strong> Such circumstances may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or to comply with the rules of a court relating to the production of records. If we receive a formal request to disclose your Personal Information in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to contact you about it, if permitted by law, via the e-mail address you provided during registration, before we respond to that request;</li>
	<li>
		If we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it;</li>

<p><strong>National Security</strong></p><p>In order to protect national security and to ensure travel security, the United States Government and other governments may request access to passenger name records, which typically includes name, flight origin, flight destination, flight time, duration of flight, seat location, travel agent, form of payment, credit card numbers, travel itinerary, address, telephone number and meal requests. In response to such request, Orbitz and/or its providers will give access to all the information you provide at the time of making the booking to the applicable government agencies of the countries to or from which you are traveling.</p><p><a href="#top">return to top</a></p><p><strong><a name="p6"></a>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we retain and store Personal information</span></strong></p><p><strong>My Trips and My Account</strong></p><p>If you are a Member, we store your Personal Information in My Trips and My Account. You can access My Trips and My Account from the <a href="http://www.orbitz.com/" target="_blank">home page</a> of our Site, after logging onto our Site. My Trips contains information about your current, canceled or past trips. My Account contains your name, e-mail address, e-mail and password settings, and departure city from which you usually travel. It may also contain other information so that you do not need to re-enter it each time you Book a Product or Service. For example, My Account may contain your billing information unless you tell us not to store it. It may also contain your date of birth, preferences for seat selection or special meals, details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers and other travel preferences. We also keep in My Account all other information that you have elected to provide us, such as gender, activities and lifestyle preferences and favorite destinations.</p><p>You can access, modify or close your account as described in <a href="#p8">How to access, modify, or close your account</a>.</p><p><strong>Third Parties’ Personal Information</strong></p><p>We will retain in your My Account, the Personal Information of individuals for whom you have made reservations or to whom we have sent Orbitz Care Alerts on your behalf.</p><p>You can access or modify these third parties’ Personal Information at any time, as described in <a href="#p8">How to access, modify, or close your account</a>.</p><p><strong><a name="RetentionandStorage"></a>Retention and Storage</strong></p><p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our Records Management Policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p><p>Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by Orbitz, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers as described in <a href="#p7">How we protect Personal Information.</a></p><p><a href="#top">return to top</a></p><p><strong><a name="p7"></a>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we protect Personal Information</span></strong></p><p>Orbitz employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require in our contracts with them that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>If you choose to contact Orbitz through our Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Orbitz assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, if you provide your credit card information on our Site’s credit card forms or if you choose to search for Products and Services, through the Orbitz mobile applications, that are located near you and we collect your geo-location, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p><p>In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.</p><p><a href="#top">return to top</a></p><p><strong><a name="p8"></a>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to access, modify or close your Account</span></strong></p><p>We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. We encourage you to visit your account to review your Personal Information. You can access your Personal Information in My Account and update it or delete inaccuracies, as necessary. For example, you can change at any time your e-mail address, activities and lifestyle preferences, favorite destinations or your preferences for receiving or not receiving commercial communications.</p><p>If you wish to close your account, you can do so by contacting us as indicated in <a href="#p13">Contact Information</a>. We will respond to such requests within 30 days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received. If you request that we close your account, we will promptly do so, to the extent possible. Once your account is closed, however, you will not be able to use many of the services available on our Site to Members, unless you re-register.</p><p>Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we are legally obligated to retain information, or for other reasons described in <a href="#RetentionandStorage">Retention and Storage</a>.</p><p><a href="#top">return to top</a></p><p><strong><a name="p9"></a>9. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy</span></strong></p><p><strong>Cookies and pixel tags</strong></p><p>A cookie is a small text file that our computer sends to your computer, and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our Site.
