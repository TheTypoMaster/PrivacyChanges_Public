    THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE iCLOUD PRODUCT, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND WEBSITES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE &ldquo;SERVICE&rdquo;). IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING TERMS. BY CLICKING &quot;AGREE,&quot; YOU ARE AGREEING THAT THESE TERMS WILL APPLY IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; min-height: 14px;">
    &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">
    Apple is the provider of the Service, which permits you to utilize certain Internet services, including storing your personal content (such as contacts, calendars, photos, notes, reminders, documents, app data, and iCloud email) and making it accessible on your compatible devices and computers, and certain location based services, only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. As soon as you enable iCloud, your content will be automatically sent to and stored by Apple, so you can later access that content or have content wirelessly pushed to your other iCloud-enabled devices or computers.&nbsp;</p>

    <b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A. Age. </b>The Service is only available to individuals aged 13 years or older, unless you are under 13 years old and your Apple ID was provided to you as a result of a request by an approved educational institution or established as part of the Family Sharing feature by your parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable parental consent. &nbsp;Parents and guardians should also remind any minors that conversing with strangers on the Internet can be dangerous and take appropriate precautions to protect children, including monitoring their use of the Service.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; min-height: 14px;">
    &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">
    To use the Service, you cannot be a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions, including the country in which you reside or from where you use the Service. By accepting this Agreement, you represent that you understand and agree to the foregoing.</p>

    <b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B. Devices and Accounts. </b>Use of the Service may require compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. Apple reserves the right to limit the number of Accounts that may be created from a device and the number of devices associated with an Account. The latest version of required software may be required for certain transactions or features. You agree that meeting these requirements is your responsibility.&nbsp;</p>

Limitations on Use.</b>&nbsp; You agree to use the Service only for purposes permitted by this Agreement, and only to the extent permitted by any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practice in the applicable jurisdiction. Your Account is allocated 5GB of storage capacity as described in the iCloud feature pages. Additional storage is available for purchase, as described below. Exceeding any applicable or reasonable limitation of bandwidth, or storage capacity (for example, backup or email account space) is prohibited and may prevent you from backing up to iCloud, adding documents, or receiving new email sent to your iCloud email address. If your use of the Service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens Apple&rsquo;s ability to provide the Service or other systems, Apple shall be entitled to take all reasonable steps to protect the Service and Apple&rsquo;s systems, which may include suspension of your access to the Service. Repeated violations of the limitations may result in termination of your Account.</p>

    Apple and its partners and licensors may provide certain features or services (e.g., Find My iPhone, Find My Friends) that rely upon device-based location information using GPS (where available) and crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. To provide such features or services, where available, Apple and its partners and licensors must collect, use, transmit, process and maintain your location data, including but not limited to the geographic location of your device and information related to your iCloud account (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;) and any devices registered thereunder, including but not limited to your Apple ID, device ID and name, and device type.&nbsp;</p>

When using third party services that use or provide location data as part of the Service, you are subject to and should review such third party&#39;s terms and privacy policy on use of location data by such third party services. Any location data provided by the Service is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but Neither Apple nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by the Service. <span style="text-decoration: underline">LOCATION-BASED SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE AS AN EMERGENCY LOCATOR SYSTEM.</span></p>

    The Service creates automatic backups for iOS devices periodically, when the device is screen locked, connected to a power source, and connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi network. iCloud will store your last three backups; however, if a device has not backed up to iCloud for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, Apple reserves the right to delete the backups associated with that device. Backup is limited to device settings, device characteristics, photos and videos, documents, messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), ringtones, app data (including Health app data), location settings (such as location-based reminders that you have set up), and Home screen and app organization. Content purchased from the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBookstore is not backed up, but may be eligible for download from those services, subject to account requirements, availability, and the applicable terms and conditions. Media synced from your computer is not backed up. If you enable iCloud Photo Library, your Photo Library will be backed up separately from the automatic iCloud backup. Your iCloud email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, and documents are stored in, and can be accessed via iCloud on your devices and computers. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but, <span style="text-decoration: underline">TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT ANY CONTENT YOU MAY STORE OR ACCESS THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO INADVERTENT DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND APPLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD SUCH DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL OCCUR.</span> It is your responsibility to maintain appropriate alternate backup of your information and data.</p>

Any photos you want to keep on a particular device permanently must be saved to the camera roll or the photo library on your computer. Photo resolution may vary depending on the device to which the photos are downloaded.&nbsp; If you do not wish to use My Photo Stream, you can turn My Photo Stream off on all of your iOS Devices or computers that have My Photo Stream enabled.
