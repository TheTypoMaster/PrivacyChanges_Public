        <h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
<p>
GAME CENTER

</p>
<p>
You agree that you will NOT use the Service to:

<p>
b. stalk, harass, threaten or harm another;
</p>
<p>
c. if you are an adult, request personal or other information from a minor (any person under the age of 18 or such other age as local law defines as a minor) who is not personally known to you, including but not limited to any of the following: full name or last name, home address, zip/postal code, telephone number, picture, email address, or the names of the minor's school, church, athletic team or friends;

<p>
PRIVACY
</p>
<p>
The Service is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy at <a href="/privacy">http://www.apple.com/privacy</a>. As set out in the Privacy Policy, when you use the Service, such as inviting other users to join the Service, participating in leader boards, enabling invitations or multiplayer functionality, or displaying status messages, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit. When playing a game that supports multiplayer functionality, other users accessing the Service from within the same game on the same Wi-Fi network, local area network or within range of Bluetooth will be able to see that you are nearby (unless you turn this feature off), and see your nickname and photo, or full profile if you have a friend relationship with such user. If you choose to have your public profile set to “on”, other users of the Service can see your full profile, including your full name, activity (such as the games you have played and when you played them), scores, and achievements, and you can be recommended as a friend to other users. If your public profile is set to “off”, only users with whom you have established a friend relationship can see your full profile, and you will not be recommended to others; only your nickname and photo will be visible to users who are not friends. If you send or receive a friend request, the full name associated with your Apple ID will be shared with those users to whom you send, or from whom you accept, a friend request, and Apple may recommend games that you have played to your friends. 
</p>
<p>
If you wish to stop sharing information with other users and the Service, see <a href="/support/">http://www.apple.com/support/</a>.
</p>
<p>
Some aspects of the Service are not available to children under 13, such as features that allow users to disclose personally identifiable information. Please enable restrictions as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
SUBMISSIONS TO THE SERVICE
</p>
<p>
The Service may offer interactive features that allow you to submit materials (including links to third-party content) on areas of the Service accessible and viewable by the public. You agree that any use by you of such features, including any materials submitted by you, shall be your sole responsibility, shall not infringe or violate the rights of any other party or violate any laws, contribute to or encourage infringing or otherwise unlawful conduct, or otherwise be obscene, objectionable or in poor taste. You also agree that you have obtained all necessary rights and licenses to make such submissions. You agree to provide accurate and complete information in connection with your submission of any materials on the Service. You hereby grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use such materials as part of the Service or in providing or marketing the Service, without any compensation or obligation to you. Apple reserves the right to not post or publish any materials and to remove or edit any material, at any time in its sole discretion without notice or liability.
</p>
<p>
Apple has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any materials submitted by you or otherwise available on the Service, to investigate any reported or apparent violation of this Agreement, and to take any action that Apple in its sole discretion deems appropriate, including, without limitation, termination hereunder or under our Copyright Policy (<a href="/legal/copyright.html">http://www.apple.com/legal/copyright.html</a>).
</p>
<p>
THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS
</p>
<p>
Certain content, and services available via the Service may include materials from third parties. Apple may provide links to third-party web sites as a convenience to you. You agree that Apple is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy and Apple does not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or web sites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties.

</p>
<p>
OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL
</p>
<p>
You understand that by using the Service, you may encounter material that you may deem to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Service at your sole risk and Apple shall have no liability to you for material that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Ratings and descriptions are provided for convenience, and you agree that Apple does not guarantee their accuracy.
</p>
<p>
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
</p>
<p>
You agree that the Service, including but not limited to graphics, user interface, audio clips, video clips, editorial content, and the scripts and software used to implement the Service, contains proprietary information and material that is owned by Apple and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary information or materials in any way whatsoever except for use of the Service in compliance with this Agreement. No portion of the Service may be reproduced in any form or by any means, except as expressly permitted in these terms.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any products, content, or other materials comprising a part of the Service at any time without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for making these changes. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain features or portions of the Service, in any case and without notice or liability.
</p>
<p>
All copyrights in and to the Service (including the compilation of content, postings, links to other Internet resources, and descriptions of those resources) and related software are owned by Apple and/or its licensors, who reserve all their rights in law and equity. THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PART OF THE SERVICE, EXCEPT FOR USE OF THE SERVICE AS PERMITTED IN THIS AGREEMENT, IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND INFRINGES ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND MAY SUBJECT YOU TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES, INCLUDING POSSIBLE MONETARY DAMAGES, FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
Apple, the Apple logo, and other Apple trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Service are trademarks or registered trademarks of Apple Inc. in the U.S. and/or other countries. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Service may be the trademarks of their respective owners. You are granted no right or license with respect to any of the aforesaid trademarks and any use of such trademarks.
</p>
<p>
TERMINATION
</p>
<p>
If you fail, or Apple suspects that you have failed, to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement, Apple, at its sole discretion, without notice to you may: (i) terminate this Agreement and/or your Account; and/or (ii) terminate the license to the Service; and/or (iii) preclude access to the Service (or any part thereof).
</p>
<p>
Apple reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) at any time with or without notice to you, and Apple will not be liable to you or to any third party should it exercise such rights.
</p>

</p>
<p>
YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE AND ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DELIVERED TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED BY APPLE HEREIN) PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" FOR YOUR USE, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</p>
<p>
IN NO CASE SHALL APPLE, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT (OR PRODUCT) POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, APPLE'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
</p>
<p>
APPLE SHALL USE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PROTECT MATERIALS OR INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, BUT YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND APPLE HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR LIABILITY RELATING TO SUCH INFORMATION IN ANY WAY.

THIS MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT SUE OR RECOVER ANY DAMAGES FROM APPLE, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, AND LICENSORS AS A RESULT OF ITS DECISION TO REMOVE OR REFUSE TO PROCESS ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT, TO WARN YOU, TO SUSPEND OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE, OR TO TAKE ANY OTHER ACTION DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION OR AS A RESULT OF APPLE'S CONCLUSION THAT A VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT HAS OCCURRED.

CHANGES
</p>
<p>
Apple reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Service.

</p>
<p>
MISCELLANEOUS
</p>
<p>
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Apple and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Apple regarding the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. Apple's failure to enforce any right or provisions in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such or any other provision. Apple will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.
</p>
<p>
The Service is operated by Apple from its offices in the United States. You agree to comply with all local, state, federal, and national laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations that apply to your use of the Service. All transactions on the Service are governed by California law, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions. Your use of the Service may also be subject to other laws. You expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with Apple or relating in any way to your use of the Service resides in the courts of the State of California. Risk of loss and title for all electronically delivered transactions pass to the purchaser in California upon electronic transmission to the recipient. No Apple employee or agent has the authority to vary this Agreement.
