                <h3>1. You must agree to these Terms of Service to use the iChat Service</h3>
                <p>The following Terms of Service (“TOS”) are between you and Apple (“Apple”, “we” or “us”) and constitute a legal agreement that governs your use of the iChat account and service (collectively, the “Service”). These TOS govern your use of the Service, which you access by signing in with a screen name or other credential (“Screen Name”) issued by us. You can agree to these TOS by: a) registering a Screen Name with us and using the Service, or b) clicking a box that indicates you agree to the Service, where such a box is made available to you. If you are an existing iChat user who registered for the Service through .Mac and are no longer a .Mac subscriber, these TOS supersede and replace the prior .Mac terms regarding your ongoing use of the Service. If you are an existing MobileMe subscriber, these TOS supplement the MobileMe TOS.  You must be legally competent to agree to these TOS. If you do not agree to any of the following terms, please do not use the Service. You should print  or otherwise save  a copy of these TOS for your records. "Apple" as used herein means Apple Inc., located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California and, where applicable, Apple Distribution International, Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Ireland.</p>
                <h3>2. Changes to these Terms of Service</h3>
                <p>Apple may update or change these TOS at any time and recommends that you review  the TOS on a regular basis. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Service after the TOS has changed constitutes your acceptance of the TOS as revised. Without limiting the foregoing, if Apple makes a change to the TOS that materially impacts your use of the Service, Apple may provide prior notice of any such change in its sole discretion.</p>
                <h3>3. Registration</h3>
                <p>Upon completing the registration information for your iChat account, you may select or we will assign to you a Screen Name and you will be required to select a password. Please choose a strong password and do not reveal your password to others. You agree that you are responsible for keeping your password confidential and secure, and further understand that you are solely responsible and liable for any activities that occur under your iChat account and Screen Name. You agree that all information you provide to Apple during the registration process will be complete and accurate information. You shall keep this information up to date while using the Service.</p>
                <h3>4. Inactive Status </h3>
                <p>You must use your Screen Name on a regular basis in order to keep it active. We reserve the right to deactivate any Screen Name that has been inactive for more than ninety (90) days. This rule does not apply to any Screen Names that are associated with a MobileMe account that is in good standing.  If your Screen Name is not tied to an active MobileMe account you must use it regularly by logging in and out of the Service in order to keep your registration active. If we deactivate a Screen Name, we have the right to reassign it to another user.</p>
                <h3> 5. Content and Your Use of the Service</h3>
                <p>”Content" means any information that may be generated or encountered through use of the Service, such as data files, written text, software, music, graphics, photographs,  images, sounds, videos, messages and any other like materials. You understand that all Content whether publicly posted or privately transmitted on the Service is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Apple, are solely responsible for any Content you upload, download, post, transmit, store or otherwise make available through your use of the Service.  You understand that by using the Service you may encounter Content that you may find offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that you may expose others to Content that they may find objectionable. Apple does not control the Content posted via the Service, nor does it guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand and agree that your use of the Service and any Content is solely at your own risk.</p>
                <p>Your use of the Service may require certain software, equipment and Internet access (“Additional Equipment”). You are responsible for providing this Additional Equipment at your own expense. You are also responsible for all activity that takes place under your iChat account, including the use of your Screen Name by others. You may use the Service for lawful purposes only. You agree that you will NOT use the Service to submit or transmit any Content, or otherwise engage in any conduct that:</p>
                <p>a.    is unlawful, harassing, threatening, harmful, tortious, defamatory, libelous, abusive, violent, obscene, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, or racially or ethnically offensive, or otherwise objectionable;</p>
                <p>b.    impersonates or misrepresents yourself as another person, business or entity, including Apple and its employees and agents;</p>
                <p>c.    violates or infringes the rights of others including patent, trade secret, copyright, trademark, publicity, or other proprietary right;</p>
                <p>d.    posts, sends, transmits or otherwise makes available, directly or indirectly, any unsolicited bulk communications (including email and instant messages), advertising, promotional materials, or junk mail, or harvests information about our users to be used for the same purpose;</p>
                <p>e.    contains viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to harm, interfere or limit the normal operation of the Service (or any part thereof), or any other computer software or hardware;</p>
                <p>f.    interferes with or disrupts the normal operations of the Service, or any servers or networks connected to the Service, or any policies, requirements or regulations of networks connected to the Service,  (including any unauthorized access to, use or monitoring of data, traffic, or equipment thereon);</p>
                <p>g.    violates these TOS.</p>
                <h3>6. Changes to the Service</h3>
                <p>Apple reserves the right to modify or stop the Service (or any part thereof), either temporarily or permanently, at any time or from time to time, with or without prior notice to you.  You agree that Apple shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or cessation of the Service. Apple may also impose certain operating guidelines or limitations upon use of the Service and reserves the right to institute or modify such limitations upon use at any time.</p>
                <h3>7. Apple Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>You understand that by using the Service, you consent and agree to the collection and use of certain information about you and your use of the Service in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy. For more information please read our full privacy policy at http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/. You further understand and agree that this information may be transferred to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Apple and/or its affiliates.</p>

Such Software will be subject to the terms of the license agreement that accompany the Software. You further agree that the Service (including the Software, or any other part thereof) contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.</p>
                <h3>9. Termination</h3>
                <p>Apple may at any time, without cause and/or prior notice, immediately terminate or suspend your Screen Name and access to the Service. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to: (a) violations of the TOS or any other policies or guidelines that are referenced herein and/or posted on the Service; (b) a request by you to cancel or terminate your account; (c) discontinuance or material modification to the Service or any part thereof; (d) a request and/or order from law enforcement, a judicial body, or other government agency; (e) where provision of the Service to you is or may become unlawful; (f) unexpected technical or security issues or problems; (g) your participation in fraudulent or illegal activities; or (h) where your account has been deactivated for inactivity as set forth above. Any such termination or suspension shall be made by Apple in its sole discretion. Upon termination of your account you lose all access to the Service, any data stored thereon, and your Screen Name. Apple will not be responsible to you or any third party for any damages that may result or arise out of such termination or suspension of your account and/or access to the Service.</p>
