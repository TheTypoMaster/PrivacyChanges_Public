This information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or other Services.  Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about yourself.</p>

</ul>
<p>Improving and customizing the Platform and advertising:</p>
<ul class="staticContent sc-list-bullet">
<li class="staticContent"><p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order to improve SoundCloud&#xAE; and customize it to your needs and interests.</p>
</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>To show you ads on behalf of advertisers, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform (e.g. by listening, favoriting or creating playlists), including location data,  together with information you provide to us through the Platform, e.g. demographic information, you choose to make available to us (such as your age or gender) directly or through third party services. This allows us to show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. Please note that we do not share personal data with advertisers. Instead, advertisers pre-define a specific audience by certain generic criteria (e.g. the city of residence, the age range, or the number of followers of an unidentified user) for a specific ad campaign. If your profile matches these generic criteria, we may choose to display a suitable ad to you. We may also display ads based on the content that you have recently viewed or searched. Before we may use location data from the app for the first time, your mobile device will generally ask you for permission first. In case you gave permission to do so, location based services in your device will collect location data for a couple of seconds. These will then be shared with us or a respective service provider.</p>
</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may send to you from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>We will not share your  information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy (including our <a href="/en/legal/cookie-policy" class="staticContent">Cookies Policy</a>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<ul class="staticContent sc-list-bullet">
<li class="staticContent"><p>Other users: Any information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages.  If you listen to any sounds uploaded by a pro user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that pro user as well as that you are following that pro user now, so that they can track the popularity of their sounds.  Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>With your consent: We will disclose your information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so.  We will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>Service providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform.  These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide their services to us.  Where we transfer personal data to these third parties, we ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into exciting new apps.  Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic Area.  Any information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers.  Please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile.  For information on how to limit the information that is available over the API, please see the <a href="#choice-and-control" class="staticContent">Choice and Control</a> section below.</p>
</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>Other networks and connected apps:  If you choose to connect your SoundCloud&#xAE; account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or networks.  In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on SoundCloud&#xAE; or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.  In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud&#xAE; account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.  This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds.  SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust.

</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>If required by law: We will disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
</li>
<li class="staticContent"><p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud&#xAE; community.</p>
</li>

<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any personal data in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above).  However, if you do decide to register a SoundCloud&#xAE; account, you can control your information in the following ways.</p>
<a name="email-preferences"></a><h3 id="email-preferences" class="staticContent">Email preferences</h3>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website.  When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>

As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud&#xAE; account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud&#xAE; using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud&#xAE; account and your Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud&#xAE;, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account. Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends&#x2019; newsfeeds. Content you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile, make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings.
<strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications.  You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud&#xAE; account to, any of these third party sites or applications.</p>
<a name="sharing-with-other-users"></a><h3 id="sharing-with-other-users" class="staticContent">Sharing with other users</h3>
<p>SoundCloud&#xAE; is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website.  By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal data or any other information which you would not like to share, you can control who has access to these sounds using the settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds).  By setting your sounds to &#x201C;private&#x201D;, rather than &#x201C;public&#x201D;, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<a name="sharing-with-app-developers"></a><h3 id="sharing-with-app-developers" class="staticContent">Sharing with app developers</h3>
<p>SoundCloud&#xAE; has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform.  If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload.  Click on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the &#x201C;Apps enabled&#x201D; box at the bottom of the page.  Please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the Website.</p>

<a name="deleting-your-account"></a><h3 id="deleting-your-account" class="staticContent">Deleting your account</h3>

Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable.  You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud&#xAE; account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages.  Search engines&apos; caching processes are outside of SoundCloud&#x2019;s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud&#xAE; Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud&#xAE; account is connected, will not delete your SoundCloud&#xAE; account.  If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account tab in your Settings on the Website.  Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your SoundCloud&#xAE; account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app.  You will need to refer to the app provider&#x2019;s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.</p>

<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal data in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
