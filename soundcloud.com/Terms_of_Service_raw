<p>The Platform includes access to customisable players (&#x201C;<strong>Players</strong>&#x201D;), and an embeddable version of the SoundCloud waveform player (&#x201C;<strong>Widget</strong>&#x201D;) for incorporation into users&#x2019; own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service.  This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader.</p>
<p>You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part.  Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorised to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre.  You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget.  The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.</p>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.</p>

<p>SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Pro Accounts from time to time.

You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the <a href="#termination" class="staticContent">Termination</a> section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your account.</p>

<p>SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be a <a href="#repeat-infringers" class="staticContent">Repeat Infringer</a> as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these Terms of Use or our <a href="/en/other/community-guidelines" class="staticContent">Community Guidelines</a>, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: <a href="#your-use-of-the-platform" class="staticContent">Your Use of the Platform</a>, <a href="#your-content" class="staticContent">Your Content</a>, <a href="#grant-of-license" class="staticContent">Grant of Licence</a> , and <a href="#representations" class="staticContent">Your Representations and Warranties</a>; (iii) SoundCloud elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by SoundCloud at its discretion.  If you have a Pro Account and your account is suspended or terminated by SoundCloud pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription.  If your account is terminated pursuant to (iii) or (iv), refunds may be payable at the reasonable discretion of SoundCloud.</p>
<p>Once your account has been terminated, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our legitimate business interests.
