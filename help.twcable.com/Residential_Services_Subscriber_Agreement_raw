These  may include video, high speed data, wireless data and Digital Home Phone services, as well as equipment-based services like DVR service.</span></a> will not change during that period.

Customer-Owned Equipment does not include Customer Use Equipment.</span></a> or <a href="#" class="tip">Customer Use Equipment<span> &ldquo;Customer Use Equipment&rdquo; means the converter  boxes, cable modems, remote controls and other pieces of equipment that we  provide to you for use inside your premises to receive the Services (and that  you must return to us if the Service is cancelled).</span></a> requirements) will remain the same or that TWC’s fees for things other than the Services (like <a href="#" class="tip">Customer Use Equipment<span> &ldquo;Customer Use Equipment&rdquo; means the converter  boxes, cable modems, remote controls and other pieces of equipment that we  provide to you for use inside your premises to receive the Services (and that  you must return to us if the Service is cancelled).</span></a> charges, late payment fees or charges for receiving paper statements) will remain the same. As an example, we offer several different Video Service packages, each of which contains a variety of channels, and the channel lineup for each package may change from time to time. In purchasing a Video Services package, you are not guaranteed any particular channels and you are not entitled to any compensation if any channels are removed from your video package.</p>
                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(c) Late Fees.</span> If you fail to pay your bill by the due date on your statement, we incur costs that we may pass on to you in the form of late fees and collection fees (including field collection fees that apply if we send someone to your home in an attempt to collect amounts you owe us). Except where late fees are set pursuant to law, these fees are based on the aggregate costs of our collection activities and may change over time and may vary by location. You confirm that these fees are difficult to determine on an individual basis and are reasonable in light of our costs in collecting past due amounts. We are entitled to charge you interest on past due amounts.</p>
                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(d) Service Suspension Fees.</span>  If we suspend any of the <a href="#" class="tip">Services<span>&quot;Services&quot; refers  to the services you buy from us.  These  may include video, high speed data, wireless data and Digital Home Phone services, as well as equipment-based services like DVR service.</span></a> we provide to you (for example, because you fail to pay amounts you owe us or because you violate our <a href="#" class="tip">Customer Agreements<span> &quot;Customer Agreements&quot; refers to the agreements, notices and policies described in the introduction to this Agreement.</span></a>), we may require that you pay us a fee for restoring your Service in addition to charging you the regular cost for such Services during the suspension.
                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(e) Bounced Checks.</span>  If your check to us “bounces” (or if your bank or payment card issuer refuses to pay us amounts you have previously authorized us to charge to your account), we may require that you pay us a fee. </p>
                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(f) Deposits.</span>  We may require a deposit or other guaranteed form of payment (for example, a payment card or bank account debit authorization) from you. If you owe us money on any account, we can deduct those amounts from any existing credit you have with us or any security deposit you provide or, if applicable, charge them to the bank or payment card account you have authorized us to use.</p>
                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(g) Purchase Authorizations.</span>  You authorize us to accept (and charge you for) any orders or requests made from your location or using your account information. For example, if someone in your home makes a long distance Home Phone call or requests a pay channel like HBO, you are responsible for the resulting charges. Similarly, if you provide any person with your <a href="#" class="tip">TWC<span>&quot;TWC&quot; means Time Warner Cable Inc. and  the local TWC-affiliated cable operators that provide our Services, or any  cable operator to whom we assign this Agreement.</span></a> user name and password, you will be responsible for the costs of anything they order using the information, whether from within your home or outside it.</p>

                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(j) Governmental Fees, Taxes and Surcharges.</span>  Since tax and regulatory rules are subject to interpretation, we have complete discretion in deciding what governmental fees and taxes to collect from you. You waive any right to (in other words, you are not eligible to receive) a refund of any fees or taxes that we collect from you and pay to any government or agency. You can receive a list of the fees and taxes we collect from: Time Warner Cable, 7800 Crescent Executive Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28217; Attention: Subscriber Tax Inquiries.</p>
                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(k) Urban Myth Debunked.</span>  You cannot settle amounts you owe us by writing “paid in full” or any other message on your bill or check.</p>

If your broadband connection or power is interrupted, you may not be able to make or receive calls or use 911, home security, or medical monitoring services.&nbsp; This is true even if your cable modem contains a battery.</p>

If you intend to use the Home Phone Service with a third party’s home security or medical monitoring system, you are responsible for making sure it works properly and for the cost of doing so. You should contact your home security or medical monitoring provider to determine whether the Home Phone Service is compatible with its systems and to test the system’s operation with the Home Phone Service.</p>
                                <p><span class="fontBold">(c) 911 Information.</span> The cable modem that we provide to you for Home Phone Service is linked to the address on your Work Order. Ensuring that your address is correctly listed with 911 databases normally takes between 24 and 120 hours from the time that you subscribe to Home Phone Service. If you move the modem to another address, you violate this <a href="#" class="tip">Agreement<span>"Agreement" means this Residential Services Subscriber Agreement, as amended from time to time.</span></a>. Furthermore, if you call 911 from the new address using the modem, emergency personnel will not be able to locate you. Also, as noted above, your Home Phone Service may not be available in the event of an electrical power outage, or if your local <a href="#" class="tip">TWC<span>&quot;TWC&quot; means Time Warner Cable Inc. and  the local TWC-affiliated cable operators that provide our Services, or any  cable operator to whom we assign this Agreement.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tip"><span>&quot;TWC&quot; means Time Warner Cable Inc. and  the local TWC-affiliated cable operators that provide our Services, or any  cable operator to whom we assign this Agreement.</span></a>system experiences service issues, and in those instances you will not be able to use the Home Phone Service to call 911.</p>

Only claims for money damages may be submitted to arbitration; claims for injunctive orders or similar relief must be brought in a court (other than claims relating to whether arbitration is appropriate, which will be decided by an arbitrator, not a court). You may not combine a claim that is subject to arbitration under this <a href="#" class="tip">Agreement<span>"Agreement" means this Residential Services Subscriber Agreement, as amended from time to time.</span></a> with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under this <a href="#" class="tip">Agreement<span>"Agreement" means this Residential Services Subscriber Agreement, as amended from time to time.</span></a>.</p>

Any arbitration award over $75,000 may  be appealed to a three-person panel appointed by the same arbitration  institution that rendered the original award.  Any such appeal must be filed within 30 days and the appeal will be  decided, based on that institution&rsquo;s appeal rules, within 120 days of filing.</p>
                                <p> <span class="fontBold">(d) Costs.</span> Before  you initiate an arbitration proceeding, you may request that we advance on your  behalf (1) the arbitration filing fees (but only to the extent they exceed your  local small claims court filing fees) and (2) the portion of the arbitrator&rsquo;s  costs for which you would normally be responsible. If <a href="#" class="tip">TWC<span>&quot;TWC&quot; means Time Warner Cable Inc. and  the local TWC-affiliated cable operators that provide our Services, or any  cable operator to whom we assign this Agreement.</span></a> wins the arbitration, you will  reimburse us for these advances. <a href="#" class="tip">TWC<span>&quot;TWC&quot; means Time Warner Cable Inc. and  the local TWC-affiliated cable operators that provide our Services, or any  cable operator to whom we assign this Agreement.</span></a> will, of course, pay any fees or costs required under the law where you live.</p>
