OUR PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: April 29, 2015
This Privacy Policy describes how J.Crew Group, Inc. and our brands and subsidiaries (including but not limited to J.Crew, crewcuts, Factory and Madewell) (collectively, "J.Crew," "we" or "us") collect, use and share information about you. This policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, shop in our stores or otherwise interact with us as described below.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy, and in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our websites or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, zip code, billing address, shipping address, phone number, payment card information, product preferences, demographic information and any other information you choose to provide.
In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you purchase a gift card for someone and request that we deliver it electronically, create and share a "wish list" or decide to purchase and ship products to someone. We will use this information to fulfill your requests and may also use that information to send marketing communications to your contact, unless he or she has previously opted out of marketing communications from J.Crew.
