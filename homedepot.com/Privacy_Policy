We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. Online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not share your password.

		Our Tracking Techniques 
	
		
	
	
	
	
		



Tracking Tools We UseWe collect personal and other information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect this information. These may include browser and flash cookies. We may also use web beacons and similar technologies. We or third parties may also collect or receive information from our mobile applications and others’ applications and use that information to provide measurement services and targeted ads. We (and our third party service providers) also use these tools:
		
		
		
	







				
					To track new visitors to our websites.
				
				
				
			

				
					To recognize returning customers.
				
				
				
			

				
					To learn what site referred you to our website or mobile application.


				
					To store your password if you are registered on our website.
				
				
				
			

				
					To personalize your experience on our website, mobile application and on third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications.


				
					To collect and store geographic data determined by the IP address of your computer.


				
					To optimize and tailor our websites and mobile applications.


				
					To make product recommendations and provide you with advertising content in which we think you will be interested. As part of this customization, we may observe your behaviors on our mobile applications, our websites or on other websites. We may also get information about your browsing history from our trusted business partners and vendors.


				
					So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors and mobile application users, and their respective interests.
				
				
				
			

				
					To provide correct pricing and ads for the local store you select.

			Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, click here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings. Your mobile device may not give you the ability to control cookies. If you wish to block cookies on our mobile applications, you will need to delete the application from your mobile device. If you configure your computer to block cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our websites. If you configure to block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. Our "Do Not Track" policy: Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

			We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads. This may include ads served on our websites or mobile applications. This may also include ads served on other companies' websites. These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties. For example, information a third party collects when you register for a website, like your zip code. This might be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our websites or on third party websites.To learn more about interest-based ads and to opt out of certain types of interest-based advertising, click here.
