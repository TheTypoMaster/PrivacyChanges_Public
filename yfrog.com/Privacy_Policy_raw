						<h3>Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act</h3>
						<p>
							ImageShack is protected under Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
							<br />
							<br />
							DMCA Title II, the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act ("OCILLA"), creates a safe harbor for online service providers (OSPs, including ISPs) against copyright liability if they adhere to and qualify for certain prescribed safe harbor guidelines and promptly block access to allegedly infringing material (or remove such material from their systems) if they receive a notification claiming infringement from a copyright holder or the copyright holder's agent. OCILLA also includes a counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users upon notice from such users claiming that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also provides for subpoenas to OSPs to provide their users' identity.
							<br />
							<br />
						</p>

The ImageShack Network may not load, any content hosted on the ImageShack Network may not load, and all abusive content will be subject to deletion. Circumventing ImageShack's ability to enforce the ImageShack Terms of Service will result in prosecution.
							<br />
							<br />
							ImageShack reserves the right to remove any content, and may replace any content with a notice stating reason for removal.
							<br />
							<br />
							Any domain hotlinking to abusive content will have that content subject to removal.
