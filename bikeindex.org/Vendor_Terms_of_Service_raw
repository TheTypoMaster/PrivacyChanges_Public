<a name="terms-of-service-for-vendors" class="anchor" href="#terms-of-service-for-vendors"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>Terms of Service for Vendors</h1>
<p>Last updated June 9th, 2014. Previous versions and the change history is <a href="https://github.com/bikeindex/bike_index_terms/">available here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="about-our-terms-of-service-for-vendors" class="anchor" href="#about-our-terms-of-service-for-vendors"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>About our terms of service for vendors</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Bike Index</strong>, an Illinois Benefit corporation. We developed a publicly-accessible bike registration service (the "Service") that gives you the ability to quickly and easily register bikes for your customers. We believe that such a service will deter bike theft.</p>
<p>By giving bike shop employees and bike advocacy organizations (the "Vendors") the ability to add bikes to the service for free we aim to encourage registration and to fight procrastinating. If you have any questions or concerns, or simply want to better understand how we do things at the Bike Index, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://www.bikeindex.org/contact_us">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>With the following brief descriptions of the parts of this Agreement, we attempt to explain the important parts of our service. But there are significant details in the whole document that make it worth reading.</p>
<h2>
<a name="bike-index-vendor-service" class="anchor" href="#bike-index-vendor-service"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>Bike Index Vendor Service</h2>
<p>We provide you with a service to register the bikes you interact with; we will respect and protect your and your customers' privacy, data and personal information. You run your business, service your customers, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations. <a href="#section_a">Complete details</a></p>
<h2>
<a name="charges-for-the-service" class="anchor" href="#charges-for-the-service"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>Charges for the Service</h2>
<p>There are charges for the use of the vendor service</p>
<h2>
<a name="becoming-a-vendor-on-the-bike-index" class="anchor" href="#becoming-a-vendor-on-the-bike-index"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>Becoming a Vendor on the Bike Index</h2>
<p>Because the Bike Index relies on partnering with bike organizations, we may need to verify your status as a bike organization. You provide us with basic information about your organization; we will seek to verify your information (we may work with third parties to do so) and approve your service account unless deemed risky (by us or our friends). You give us permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information or we otherwise must decline to offer you the service. <a href="#section_c">Complete details</a></p>
<h2>
<a name="termination-and-other-legal-terms" class="anchor" href="#termination-and-other-legal-terms"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>Termination and Other Legal Terms</h2>
<p>We can deactivate your ability to register new bikes or terminate this agreement at any time (especially if you do something bad). You can also terminate anytime. Termination is effective immediately. Termination does not alter your previously registered bikes. This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment). <a href="#section_d">Complete details</a></p>
