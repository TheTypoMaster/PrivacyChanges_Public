Domain Name Registration Agreement

<p><strong>Last Revised: August 26, 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.</strong></p>
<p><strong class="heading1">1. OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>This Domain Name Registration Agreement (this "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agreement</span>") is entered into by and between GoDaddy.com, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">GoDaddy</span>") and you, and is made effective as of the date of electronic acceptance.&nbsp; This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of GoDaddy's Domain Name Registration services (the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Domain Name Registration Services</span>" or the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Services</span>").&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your electronic acceptance of this Agreement signifies that you have read, understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Agreement, along with (i) GoDaddy<span>&rsquo;s</span> <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/agreements/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=UTOS" target="_blank">Universal Terms of Service Agreement</a>, and (ii) any plan limits, product disclaimers or other restrictions presented to you on the Domain Name Registration Services landing page of the GoDaddy website (this &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Site</span>&rdquo;), both (i) and (ii) of which are incorporated herein by reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms "we", "us" or "our" shall refer to GoDaddy.&nbsp; The terms "you", "your", "User" or "customer" shall refer to any individual or entity who accepts this Agreement.&nbsp; Unless otherwise specified, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that (i) GoDaddy, in its sole and absolute discretion, may change or modify this Agreement, and any policies or agreements which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to this Site, and (ii) your use of this Site or the Services found at this Site after such changes or modifications have been made&nbsp;shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as last revised.&nbsp; If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement as last revised, do not use (or continue to use) this Site or the Services found at this Site.&nbsp; In addition, GoDaddy may occasionally notify you of changes or modifications to this Agreement by email.&nbsp; It is therefore very important that you keep your shopper account (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shopper Account</span>&rdquo;) information, including your email address, current.&nbsp; GoDaddy assumes no liability or responsibility for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure results from an inaccurate or out-of-date email address.</p>
<p> GoDaddy is an Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ICANN</span>") accredited registrar.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that as an ICANN-accredited registrar, GoDaddy is bound by an agreement with ICANN. You acknowledge and agree that GoDaddy may modify this Agreement in order to comply with its agreement with ICANN, as well as any other terms and conditions set forth by (i) ICANN and/or (ii) the registry applicable to the top level domain ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">TLD</span>") or country code top level domain ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ccTLD</span>") in question. &nbsp;As used herein, the terms "registry", "Registry", "registry operator" or "Registry Operator" shall refer to the registry applicable to the TLD or ccTLD in question.&nbsp; To identify the sponsoring registrar, click <a href="http://www.internic.net/whois.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to domain name registrations, we may offer a variety of products that can be added to your domain name registration. Your purchase and use of each additional product is subject to both the general terms and conditions and the specific terms and conditions for each product as set forth in this Agreement</p>
<p><strong class="heading1">2. fees and payments</strong></p>
<p><strong><em class="heading1">(a) general terms, including automatic renewal terms</em></strong></p>
<p>You agree to pay any and all prices and fees (including any registration fees required by ICANN) due for Services purchased at this Site at the time you order the Services.&nbsp; All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted, even if your Services are suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term.&nbsp; GoDaddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.&nbsp; If you have purchased Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where refunds are issued, GoDaddy's issuance of a refund receipt is confirmation that GoDaddy has submitted your refund to the Payment Method (as defined below) charged at the time of the original sale.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that the associated payment provider and/or individual issuing bank establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund.&nbsp; Refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle.</p>
<p>You may pay for Services by providing a valid credit card, an electronic check (from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate), PayPal (as defined in the Universal Terms of Service Agreement), Alipay (as defined in the Universal Terms of Service Agreement), or by using GoDaddy's "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good As Gold Prepaid Services</span>" to establish a cash reserve for charge by GoDaddy (each, a "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment Method</span>").&nbsp; For Services that offer "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Express Checkout</span>", clicking the Express Checkout button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary Payment Method on file for your Shopper Account.&nbsp; Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Shopper Account. Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Shopper Account.</p>
<p>If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-transform : uppercase;">In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, most Services offer an automatic renewal option.&nbsp; The automatic renewal option automatically renews the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the&nbsp;original service period.&nbsp; For example, if your&nbsp;original service period was for one year, your renewal period will be for one year.&nbsp; While the details of the automatic renewal option vary from Service to Service, the Services that offer an automatic renewal option treat it as the default setting.&nbsp; Therefore, unless you disable the automatic renewal option, GoDaddy will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy at GoDaddy's then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period.&nbsp; In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into your Account manager ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?isc=" target="_blank">Account Manager</a></span>") from this Site and follow the steps found <a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/1042?prog_id=GoDaddy" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; You may enable or disable the automatic renewal option at any time.&nbsp; However, should you elect to disable the automatic renewal option and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-transform : uppercase;">In addition, GoDaddy may participate in "recurring billing programs" or "account updater services" supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank's participation).&nbsp; If you are enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us.&nbsp; In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, GoDaddy will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf. GoDaddy makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) setting your renewal options and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid.&nbsp; Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</span></p>
<p>If for any reason GoDaddy is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if GoDaddy is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. If you pay by credit card and if for any reason GoDaddy is unable to charge your credit card with the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if GoDaddy is charged back for any fee it previously charged to the credit card you provided, you agree that GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that the remedies GoDaddy may pursue in order to effect payment shall include, but not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to you of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. GoDaddy reserves the right to charge you reasonable "administrative fees" or "processing fees" for (i) tasks GoDaddy may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs GoDaddy may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical scenarios include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention, fees incurred by third-party payment providers such as PayPal, Alipay, and Certegy (as defined in the Universal Terms of Service Agreement), fees incurred as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank, or a Payment Method processor, and disputes that require accounting or legal services. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GoDaddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies; however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S. dollars and a select number of the currency options displayed on this Site ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supported Currency</span>" or "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supported Currencies</span>"). If the currency selected is a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment. If the currency selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in U.S. dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase. In either case (whether the currency selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank.&nbsp; In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and GoDaddy makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing). In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added Tax ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">VAT</span>"), Goods and Services Tax ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">GST</span>"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Universal Terms of Service Agreement for further details regarding the individual Payment Methods referenced above.</p>
<p><strong><em class="heading1">(b) domain name renewal terms</em></strong></p>
<p>When you register a domain name, you will have three renewal options: (i) "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Renewal</span>", (ii) "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extended Automatic Renewal</span>", and (iii) "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manual Renewal</span>":&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Renewal</span>.&nbsp; Automatic Renewal is the default setting. Therefore, unless you select either Extended Automatic Renewal or Manual Renewal, GoDaddy will enroll you in the Automatic Renewal plan.&nbsp; If you enroll in the Automatic Renewal plan, GoDaddy will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extended Automatic Renewal</span>.&nbsp; If you enroll in the Extended Automatic Renewal plan, GoDaddy will automatically renew any domain name that is up for renewal for an additional one-year period on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration, so the initial registration period will always remain intact.&nbsp; Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your two (2) year registration period will always remain intact. If you have chosen to register your domain name for five (5) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your five (5) year registration period will always remain intact, and so on.&nbsp; GoDaddy will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current one-year domain name registration rate.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manual Renewal</span>.&nbsp; If you do not select that the domain name be automatically renewed (through either Automatic Renewal or Extended Automatic Renewal), you have the responsibility of logging into the Domain Manager portion of your <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?isc=" target="_blank">Account Manager</a> for that domain name and manually implementing the renewal by the expiration date (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</li>
</ol>
<p>All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.&nbsp; Domain name renewals will be non-refundable. If for any reason GoDaddy is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire. It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.</p>
<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .br, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,&nbsp;and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.</p>
<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,&nbsp;and .vg), you must renew no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status. For some ccTLDs (.es) you must renew no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.&nbsp; When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling GoDaddy and requesting that the domain name be renewed. You cannot renew the domain name through your <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?isc=" target="_blank">Account Manager</a>. If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</p>
<p>You agree that GoDaddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew, either automatically or manually in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement. In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p>If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If GoDaddy decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal and keep your domain name.

However, the Service protects against and prevent both kinds of transfers. Once You have elected to purchase the Service for any and all domain names, the automatic renewal function will be activated for each domain name and those names will not be transferable until the renewal of the Service. Accordingly, You acknowledge and agree You have carefully considered the implications accompanying the purchase of the Service and understand the restrictions the Service will place upon Your ability to transfer any domain names for which You have purchased the Service. You further acknowledge and agree any domain name for which You have purchased the Service will not be transferable for any reason until the next regularly occurring renewal of such domain name, provided, You have previously elected to deactivate the Service for that particular domain name, which deactivation may not occur until the expiration of the current term of the Service. By way of example and not as a limitation, if You elect to purchase the Service for a domain name, which You have registered for a period of five (5) years, the Service will remain active for the same five (5) year period and You will not be able to engage in any transfer whatsoever of that domain name during such five (5) year period. </p>

As result, we have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the domain names listed. Domain names listed may be withdrawn at any time by the seller or by us.&nbsp; We act as a transaction facilitator to help You make and receive payments from third parties.&nbsp;We are&nbsp;not an escrow agent, rather we act as Your agent based upon Your direction and requests to use the Services that require us to perform tasks on Your behalf. We will not use Your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose.

<p>2. Your Obligations.</p>

In the event You are unable to comply or fail to comply with Your obligations under this Agreement, we expressly reserves the right to delist any or all of Your domain names immediately upon becoming aware of Your failure to comply.&nbsp; You may list Your domain name for any duration offered on the web site. You agree to pay the listing fee associated with the duration period You choose at the time of the listing. You may choose to supplement the listing with various additional services provided, if any. By using the additional services, You agree to pay any additional charges we&nbsp;may associate with the additional services. We reserve the right to modify its pricing structure at any time. If You find a Buyer using the Services, the transaction must be completed within the Services. For each transaction completed within the Services, You agree to pay us a transaction fee according to the fee schedule published on the site . Such transaction fee will be payable directly to us. You agree You will not sell the domain name to any Buyer found through the Services without using the Services to complete the transaction. Should we find You are circumventing the Services, we reserve the right to terminate Your account and cancel all of Your listings.&nbsp; In the event that you update your sale price, you acknowledge and agree that it may take up to 24 hours to update the price shown to buyers.&nbsp; In the event your domain name sells prior to the price being updated on the website, you agree that the price listed will be enforced.</p>
<p><em>Purchasing Domain Names. </em>As a Buyer, You are obligated to complete the transaction if You purchase the domain name. You acknowledge that some listed domain names may be subject to an additional registration fee. For those domain names, the registration fee will be added to the price to form the purchase price. You agree that by completing the transaction, You are responsible for payment of the registration fee. By initiating and sending payments through the Service, You appoint us as Your agent to obtain the funds on Your behalf and transfer them to the recipient You designate. We will obtain the funds first by the Payment Method You have designated. If there are insufficient funds or invalid credit card information, we may obtain the remaining funds by charging any Payment Method You have on file. Once You send payment, we will hold those funds as Your agent for a prescribed period of time based on the type of transaction, at which time we will release the funds to the Seller. At no time will You be able to withdraw those funds or send the funds to another recipient unless the initial transaction is canceled. Should the Seller refuse payment, the funds, minus the administration fee as outlined in the pricing structure, will be returned to You. You agree that we are not responsible for payments refused by Seller.</p>

<p><em>Selling Domain Names. </em>As a Seller, You are obligated to complete the transaction if the Buyer commits to purchase the domain. By receiving payments through the Service, You appoint us as Your Agent to receive and deposit funds on Your behalf. You must, at the time of listing of Your domain name, establish a payee account. Payments for completed domain name sales will be credited to Your payee account.&nbsp; After a fraud holding period, if no fraud has been detected, your funds will be paid according to the payment method you select in your payee account.&nbsp; Typically, payments are made as follows:</p>

The authority granted to us by the payee account owner herein will remain in full force and effect until we have received written notification from the payee account owner that such authority has been revoked, but in any event, such writing shall be provided in such a manner as to afford us a reasonable opportunity to act on such revocation, or until we have sent notice to terminate this Agreement. In the event of a payment charge back, we will deduct the amount of the payment from Seller's payment method on file.

Such actions may include, but are not limited to, (a) disabling the website pending resolution of the conflict and/or redirecting the DENIC domain name(s) to a blank page or placeholder; (b) cancelling the registration of the DENIC domain name(s); (c) ceasing administration of the domain name and placing it in a transit state; (d) removing or replacing the Admin-C from or in the Whois record, (e) redirecting the DENIC domain name(s) to an alternate IP address; (f) allowing the registration of the DENIC domain name(s) to lapse; (g) transferring the registration to an individual or entity which is awarded the registration through any court proceeding, arbitration, or by DENIC; (h) settling any and all third-party claims, whether threatened or made, arising out of your use of the DENIC domain name(s); and/or (i) terminating the Local Presence Service.

Correspondence sent to us or you shall be regarded as delivered. Key-Systems or the Admin-C may, at its own discretion, request a security for its expenses which may occur in case a third party alleges that the use of the domain name is an infringement of laws. The amount of security will be determined at the Admin-C discretion in accordance with the Court Costs (GKG) and the Attorney's Remuneration Act (RVG). The security must be paid in cash or guaranteed by a major German bank or savings bank (Sparkasse) within the time limit set by Key-Systems and/or the Admin-C.</p>

THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF VERISIGN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. BECAUSE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE LIMITATION OR ELIMINATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, KEY-SYSTEM'S LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We and you agree to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Key-Systems, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, agents, directors, officers and employees and the individual designated as Admin-C for the DENIC domain name(s), from and against any and all claims (including, but not limited to, claims of trademark infringement or cybersquatting), demands, liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or related in any way to, the Local Presence Services, the DEMINC domain name(s), and/or your use of the DEMIN domain name(s).</p>
