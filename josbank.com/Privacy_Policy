Upon submission of your email address through the entry form, you will be automatically entered with one (1) entry into the Sweepstakes. All entries become the property of Sponsor and will not be returned or acknowledged, and Sponsor will not verify receipt of entries. Sponsor and its agencies are not responsible for lost, late, incomplete, damaged, stolen, misdirected, or illegible entries, which will be disqualified. Sponsor is not responsible for transmission, typing, and/or computer error. Limit: one entry per person during the Sweepstakes Period. Bulk, automated, or third party entries are prohibited and will be disqualified. Multiple participants are not permitted to use the same email address. Any attempt by any participant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple or different identities, forms, or email addresses or any other methods will void all of that participant’s entries, and that participant may be disqualified at Sponsor’s discretion. In the event of a dispute as to any entry, the authorized account holder of the email address used to enter will be deemed to be the registered player. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address. Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder or forfeit the prize. Entries specifying an invalid, non-working, or inactive email address will be disqualified and ineligible to win.

You may remove your email address from future email marketing promotions by following the instructions on any email marketing promotion.  Information collected from entrants is subject to the Sponsor’s Privacy Policy, which may be found at http://www.josbank.com/privacy-policy. 
4. PRIZE DRAWINGS:  A random drawing will be held on or about the first day of each month from among all eligible entries received in the previous month.

Noncompliance with the foregoing, failure to abide by these Official Rules, failure to respond within seven (7) days after the first attempt to contact the potential winner or return of the prize notification or prize as undeliverable may result in disqualification and the naming of an alternate potential winner. Up to 3 alternate drawings will be held, after which any remaining prizes will remain un-awarded. No compensation will be given upon prize forfeiture for any reason. Unaccepted prizes may not be awarded within sole discretion of Sponsor. Sponsor is not responsible for any change of mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number of entrants.

9. GENERAL CONDITIONS:  This Sweepstakes is governed by the laws of the United States. Void in Puerto Rico, outside the United States and where prohibited by law.
