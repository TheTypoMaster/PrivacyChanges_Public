For one thing, we want your feedback and suggestions on how to make our service better. (We’d really like to hear from you: email your input to terms@medium.com.) For another, by using Medium Services, you agree to be bound by everything in these Terms. If you don’t agree to the Terms, please don’t use Medium.Your contentYou own the rights to the content you post on Medium. We don’t claim ownership over any of it. However, by posting or transferring content to Medium, you give us permission to use your content solely to do the things we need to do to provide Medium Services, including, without limitation, storing, displaying, reproducing, and distributing your content. This may include promoting your content with partner companies or services for broader broadcast, distribution, or publication.We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.By publishing on Medium, you agree to allow others to view your content.We don’t pre-screen user content, but we have the right (though no obligation) to refuse or remove any content you post or transfer to Medium Services for any reason.You are free to delete your content from Medium at any time, though there may be a delay in removing it from public view due to operational requirements. We retain, but do not publicly display, backup copies of your deleted content on our servers for 30 days after you delete your account. If you delete your account or content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.You’re responsible for the content you submit to Medium and assume all risks associated with it, including anyone else’s reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights. By posting, you represent that you own or have the necessary rights to post the content on Medium, and that doing so doesn’t conflict with any other licenses you’ve granted.Aside: We get a lot of questions about whether you can post content you own on Medium if you’ve already posted it elsewhere, like on your blog. The answer is yes. If you own the content, you’re welcome to copy it from other places and publish it on Medium (and vice versa) as long as you didn’t give exclusive rights to other platforms or publishers.Our contentThe look and feel of Medium Services are copyright A Medium Corporation.

Let’s rest a moment, shall we? You’ve earned it. So far, so good, right? Everything pretty clear? Well, don’t get too comfortable. Now’s the time to activate the full Galactic Armada of your legal vocabulary comprehension and ALL CAPS READING SKILLS. What follows are several sections of heavily lawyered-up provisions that we would love to express in a more human-readable, less legal manner. But their form and substance has evolved over time, often via brutal, hand-to-hand litigation or not-to-be-ignored authoritative rulings from courts and interpretations by agencies. This gives us little flexibility in the wording, at least if we want to avoid being laughed out of court in some Doomsday scenario that neither of us even wants to think about. So these following provisions are important, you should read them carefully, and we apologize for the excruciating lawyerly patois.Miscellaneous lawyerly provisions (please read these carefully)1.
