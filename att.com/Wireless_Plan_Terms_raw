<div style="margin-left: 20px;"><p><a name="whatIsTheTermOfMyService" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>What Is The Term Of My Service? How Can I Fulfill My Service Commitment? What are My Rights to Cancel Service and Terminate My Agreement?</u></b></p>
<p>AT&amp;T Wireless Service(s) may be used with: (a) a mobile device that contains a SIM that is assigned to your account (“Device”) and/or, (b) a device that is designed and purchased for use exclusively on AT&amp;T's network (&quot;Equipment&quot;).</p>
<p><b>Term of Service.</b> Your Agreement begins on the day we activate your Service(s) and continues through the Term of Service, typically a 12 month or 24 month period (“Service Commitment”), specified on your Customer Service Summary. At the end of your service commitment, this Agreement will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis. If your Agreement has no Service Commitment, it is a month-to-month Agreement.</p>
<p><b>Fulfillment of Service Commitment.</b> You have received certain benefits from us in exchange for your Service Commitment, which may include, but are not limited to, a subsidized wireless device. There are two alternative ways to fulfill your Service Commitment. You can pay for the Services described in your Customer Service Summary for the term of your Service Commitment, or you can terminate your Agreement prior to the end of your Service Commitment and pay an Early Termination Fee (“ETF”). The Early Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is an alternative means for you to perform your obligations under the Agreement that partially compensates us for the fact that the Service Commitment on which your rate plan is based was not completed.</p>
<p><b>Your Termination Rights.</b> Within the first 14 days after service activation, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason and not be required to pay an ETF. If you terminate within three (3) days of accepting the Agreement, AT&amp;T will refund your activation fee, if any. However, you agree to pay AT&amp;T for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement, and you agree to return to AT&amp;T any Equipment you purchased from AT&amp;T in connection with your Service Commitment. If you fail to return this Equipment, you will be charged the difference between the amount you paid AT&amp;T for the Equipment and the amount you would have been charged for the Equipment had you not agreed to a Service Commitment. AT&amp;T also may charge you a restocking fee for any returned Equipment. Some dealers may impose additional fees.</p>
<p>After the first 14 days, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason. However, you agree to pay AT&amp;T for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement along with the applicable ETF. The Early Termination Fee is either: (a) $325 or (b) $150. The ETF reduces each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete. To determine whether your Equipment has a $325 Early Termination Fee or a $150 Early Termination Fee, and the amount of reduction, check <a href="http://www.att.com/equipmentETF" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>att.com/equipmentETF</u></a>.</p>
<p>After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, you may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice without incurring an ETF. If you sign a new Agreement before the end of the term of your existing Agreement and terminate that new Agreement within 14 days as allowed above, you agree that you will be bound by the terms and conditions of your existing Agreement including fulfillment of any remaining Service Commitment thereunder.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T may interrupt, suspend or cancel your Services and terminate your Agreement without advance notice for any reason including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
<li>Any conduct that we believe violates this Agreement or AT&amp;T’s Acceptable Use Policy;</li>
<li>Any conduct that involves the use of abusive, derogatory, insulting, threatening, vulgar or similarly unreasonable language or behavior directed at any of our employees&nbsp;or representatives whether it be in person, over the phone, or in writing;</li>
<li>Any abusive use of our network or Services;</li>
<li>You use your Device/Equipment and/or our Services for an unlawful or fraudulent purpose;</li>
<li>You use your Device/Equipment and/or our Services in any way that: (a) is harmful to, interferes with, or negatively affects our network, other customers, or the network of any&nbsp;other provider, (b) is harmful to, interferes with, or negatively affects our Services or operations, (c) infringes intellectual property rights of AT&amp;T or others, (d) results in the&nbsp;publication of threatening, offensive or illegal material, or (e) generates spam or other abusive messaging or calling, a security risk, or a violation of privacy;</li>
<li>You resell our Services either alone or as part of any other good or service;</li>
<li>You fail to make all required payments when due;</li>
<li>Your credit has deteriorated and/or we believe that there is a risk of non-payment;</li>
<li>You refuse to pay any required advance payment or deposit;</li>
<li>We discover that you are underage;</li>
<li>You provide inaccurate or misleading credit information; or</li>
<li>You modify your device from its manufacturer’s specifications.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>AT&amp;T's rights under this Section 1.2 are in addition to any specific rights that we reserve in other provisions of this Agreement to interrupt, suspend, modify, or cancel your Services and terminate your Agreement.</p>
<p>After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, AT&amp;T may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice.</p>

<p><a name="canAttChangeMyTermsRates" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Can AT&amp;T Change My Terms And Rates?</u></b></p>
<p>We may change any terms, conditions, rates, fees, expenses, or charges regarding your Services at any time. We will provide you with notice of material changes (other than changes to governmental fees, proportional charges for governmental mandates, roaming rates or administrative charges) either in your monthly bill or separately. You understand and agree that State and Federal Universal Service Fees and other governmentally imposed fees, whether or not assessed directly upon you, may be increased based upon the government's or our calculations.</p>
<p>IF WE INCREASE THE PRICE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES TO WHICH YOU SUBSCRIBE, BEYOND THE LIMITS SET FORTH IN YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUMMARY, OR IF WE MATERIALLY DECREASE THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA IN WHICH YOUR AIRTIME RATE APPLIES (OTHER THAN A TEMPORARY DECREASE FOR REPAIRS OR MAINTENANCE), WE’LL DISCLOSE THE CHANGE AT LEAST ONE BILLING CYCLE IN ADVANCE (EITHER THROUGH A NOTICE WITH YOUR BILL, A TEXT MESSAGE TO YOUR DEVICE, OR OTHERWISE), AND YOU MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT PAYING AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE OR RETURNING OR PAYING FOR ANY PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, PROVIDED YOUR NOTICE OF TERMINATION IS DELIVERED TO US WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE FIRST BILL REFLECTING THE CHANGE.</p>
<p>If you lose your eligibility for a particular rate plan, we may change your rate plan to one for which you qualify.</p>

<p><a name="whatChargesAmIResponsibleFor" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>How Will I Receive My Bill? What Charges Am I Responsible For? How Much Time Do I Have To Dispute My Bill?</u></b></p>
<p>You will receive an electronic (paperless) bill at AT&amp;T’s online account management site unless you tell us you want a paper bill. You will be given the option to choose electronic billing or paper billing when you purchase service. Each month we will send you an email notice when your electronic bill is available online. This will be sent to your official email address on file with AT&amp;T. You are required to keep your email address current and to notify us immediately of any change in your email address. You always have the option of switching back to a paper bill by changing your billing preferences at AT&amp;T’s online account management site. You will not receive a paper bill in the mail unless you expressly request one.</p>
<p>You are responsible for paying all charges for or resulting from Services provided under this Agreement, including any activation fee that may apply to each voice or data line. You will receive monthly bills that are due in full.</p>
<p>IF YOU DISPUTE ANY CHARGES ON YOUR BILL, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING AT AT&amp;T BILL DISPUTE, 1025 LENOX PARK, ATLANTA, GA 30319 WITHIN 100 DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE BILL OR YOU’LL HAVE WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE THE BILL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY LEGAL ACTION RAISING SUCH DISPUTE.</p>
<p>Charges include, without limitation, airtime, roaming, recurring monthly service, activation, administrative, and late payment charges; regulatory cost recovery and other surcharges; optional feature charges; toll, collect call and directory assistance charges; restoral and reactivation charges; any other charges or calls billed to your phone number; and applicable taxes and governmental fees, whether assessed directly upon you or upon AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>To determine your primary place of use (&quot;PPU&quot;) and which jurisdiction's taxes and assessments to collect, you’re required to provide us with your residential or business street address. If you don’t provide us with such address, or if it falls outside our licensed Services area, we may reasonably designate a PPU within the licensed Services area for you. You must live and have a mailing address within AT&amp;T's owned network coverage area.</p>
<br>
<p><a name="howDoesAttCalcMyBill" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>How Does AT&amp;T Calculate My Bill?</u></b></p>
<p>Usage and monthly fees will be billed as specified in your customer service summary or rate plan information online. If the Equipment you order is shipped to you, your Services may be activated before you take delivery of the Equipment so that you can use it promptly upon receipt. Thus, you may be charged for Services while your Equipment is still in transit. If, upon receiving your first bill, you have been charged for Services while your Equipment was in transit, you may contact Customer Care 1-800-331-0500 to request a credit. Except as provided below, monthly Services and certain other charges are billed one month in advance, and there is no proration of such charges if Service is terminated on other than the last day of your billing cycle. Monthly Service and certain other charges are billed in arrears if you’re a former customer of AT&amp;T Wireless and maintain uninterrupted Service on select AT&amp;T rate plans, however, if you elect to receive your bills for your Services combined with your wireline phone bill (where available) you will be billed in advance as provided above. You agree to pay for all services used with your Device.</p>
<p>AIRTIME AND OTHER MEASURED USAGE (&quot;CHARGEABLE TIME&quot;) IS BILLED IN FULL-MINUTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL AIRTIME AND USAGE ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-MINUTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH CALL FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&amp;T CHARGES A FULL MINUTE OF AIRTIME USAGE FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST MINUTE OF AIRTIME USED ON EACH WIRELESS CALL. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN YOUR PLAN, MINUTES WILL BE DEPLETED ACCORDING TO USAGE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: NIGHT AND WEEKEND MINUTES, MOBILE TO MOBILE MINUTES, ANYTIME MINUTES AND ROLLOVER, EXCEPT THAT MINUTES THAT ARE PART OF BOTH A LIMITED PACKAGE AND AN UNLIMITED PACKAGE WILL NOT BE DEPLETED FROM THE LIMITED PACKAGE. Chargeable Time begins for outgoing calls when you press SEND (or similar key) and for incoming calls when a signal connection from the caller is established with our facilities. Chargeable Time ends after you press END (or similar key), but not until your wireless telephone's signal of call disconnect is received by our facilities and the call disconnect signal has been confirmed.</p>
<p>All outgoing calls for which we receive answer supervision or which have at least 30 seconds of Chargeable Time, including ring time, shall incur a minimum of one minute airtime charge. Answer supervision is generally received when a call is answered; however, answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment. Chargeable Time may include time for us to recognize that only one party has disconnected from the call, time to clear the channels in use, and ring time. Chargeable Time may also occur from other uses of our facilities, including by way of example, voicemail deposits and retrievals, and call transfers. Calls that begin in one rate period and end in another rate period may be billed in their entirety at the rates for the period in which the call began.</p>
<p>DATA TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS CALCULATED IN FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH DATA SESSION FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&amp;T CALCULATES A FULL KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE USED ON EACH DATA SESSION. TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS BILLED EITHER BY THE KILOBYTE (“KB”) OR MEGABYTE (&quot;MB&quot;). IF BILLED BY MB, THE FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED AND ROUNDED UP TO NEXT FULL MB INCREMENT TO DETERMINE BILLING. IF BILLED BY KB, THE FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED TO DETERMINE BILLING. NETWORK OVERHEAD, SOFTWARE UPDATE REQUESTS, EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS, AND RESEND REQUESTS CAUSED BY NETWORK ERRORS CAN INCREASE MEASURED KILOBYTES. DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE OCCURS WHENEVER YOUR DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK AND IS ENGAGED IN ANY DATA TRANSMISSION, AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN SECTION 6.4.</p>
<p>If you select a rate plan that includes a predetermined allotment of Services (for example, a predetermined amount of airtime, megabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such rate plan, any unused allotment of Services from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle. We may bill you in a format as we determine from time to time. Additional charges may apply for additional copies of your bill, or for detailed information about your usage of Services.</p>
<p><b>Delayed Billing:</b> Billing of usage for calls, messages, data or other Services (such as usage when roaming on other carriers’ networks, including internationally) may occasionally be delayed. Such usage charges may appear in a later billing cycle, will be deducted from Anytime monthly minutes or other Services allotments for the month when the usage is actually billed, and may result in additional charges for that month. Those minutes will be applied against your Anytime monthly minutes in the month in which the calls appear on your bill. You also remain responsible for paying your monthly Service fee if your Service is suspended for nonpayment. We may require payment by money order, cashier's check, or a similarly secure form of payment at our discretion.</p>
<br>
<p><a name="areAdvPaymentsAndDepositsReq" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are Advance Payments And/Or Deposits Required?</u></b></p>
<p>We may require you to make deposits or advance payments for Services, which we may offset against any unpaid balance on your account. Interest won’t be paid on advance payments or deposits unless required by law. We may require additional advance payments or deposits if we determine that the initial payment was inadequate. Based on your creditworthiness as we determine it, we may establish a credit limit and restrict Services or features. If your account balance goes beyond the limit we set for you, we may immediately interrupt or suspend Services until your balance is brought below the limit. Any charges you incur in excess of your limit become immediately due. If you have more than one account with us, you must keep all accounts in good standing to maintain Services. If one account is past due or over its limit, all accounts in your name are subject to interruption or termination and all other available collection remedies.</p>

<p>You agree that for each bill not paid in full by the due date, AT&amp;T may charge and you will pay a late payment fee of $5. Restrictive endorsements are void.</p>
<p>You expressly authorize, and specifically consent to allowing, AT&amp;T and/or its outside collection agencies, outside counsel, or other agents to contact you in connection with any and all matters relating to unpaid past due charges billed by AT&amp;T to you. You agree that, for attempts to collect unpaid past due charges, such contact may be made to any mailing address, telephone number, cellular phone number, e-mail address, or any other electronic address that you have provided, or may in the future provide, to AT&amp;T. You agree and acknowledge that any e-mail address or any other electronic address that you provide to AT&amp;T is your private address and is not accessible to unauthorized third parties. For attempts to collect unpaid charges, you agree that in addition to individual persons attempting to communicate directly with you, any type of contact described above may be made using, among other methods, pre-recorded or artificial voice messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, pre-set e-mail messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system, or any other pre-set electronic messages delivered by any other automatic electronic messaging system.</p>

<p>You may receive or be eligible for certain discounts, credits, promotions, and other benefits (&quot;Benefits&quot;) through a business or government customer's agreement with us (&quot;Business Agreement&quot;). All such Benefits are provided to you solely as a result of the corresponding Business Agreement, and may be modified or terminated without notice.

<p>If a business or government entity pays your charges or is otherwise liable for the charges, you authorize us to share your account information with it or its authorized agents. If you use Service(s) and/or receive certain Benefits tied to a Business Agreement with us, but you’re liable for your own charges, then you authorize us to share enough account information with it or its authorized agents to verify your continuing eligibility for those Services or Benefits.</p>
<p>You may receive Benefits because of your agreement to have the charges for your Services, billed (&quot;Joint Billing&quot;) by a wireline company affiliated with AT&amp;T (&quot;Affiliate&quot;) or because you subscribe to certain services provided by an Affiliate. If you cancel Joint Billing or the Affiliate service your rates will be adjusted without notice to a rate plan for which you qualify.</p>

Individuals that can provide information we deem sufficient to identify you and that also have access to a device that is billed to your account may register for secondary access to your account in AT&amp;T’s online account management system (&quot;myAT&amp;T&quot;).

<p><b>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</b></p>
<p><u>Summary:</u></p>
<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 1-800-331-0500. <b>In the unlikely event that AT&amp;T's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</b> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <b>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</b> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&amp;T will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&amp;T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.</p>
<p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&amp;T has offered you to settle the dispute.</p>
<br>
<p><a name="arbAgreement" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Arbitration Agreement</u></b></p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;"><p>(1) AT&amp;T and you agree to arbitrate <b>all disputes and claims</b> between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>
<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>
<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>References to &quot;AT&amp;T,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; and &quot;us&quot; include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. <b>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and AT&amp;T are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</b> This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 (&quot;Notice Address&quot;). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;Demand&quot;). If AT&amp;T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AT&amp;T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&amp;T is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href="http://www.att.com/arbitration-forms" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>att.com/arbitration-forms</u></a>.</p>
<p>(3) After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>adr.org</u></a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at <a href="http://www.att.com/arbitration-information" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>att.com/arbitration-information</u></a>.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&amp;T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p>
<p>(4) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of AT&amp;T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&amp;T will:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
<li>pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (&quot;the alternative payment&quot;), whichever is greater; and</li>
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for&nbsp;investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (&quot;the attorney premium&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>(5) The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such an award.</p>
<p>(6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. <b>YOU AND AT&amp;T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, unless both you and AT&amp;T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
<p>(7) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&amp;T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your Service Commitment, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>

If there are charges on your bill for calls made after the Device was lost or stolen, but before you reported it to us, notify us of the disputed charges and we will investigate. You may submit documents, statements and other information to show any charges were not authorized. You may be asked to provide information and you may submit information to support your claim. We will advise you of the result of our investigation within 30 days. While your phone is suspended you will remain responsible for complying with all other obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, your monthly fee. We both have a duty to act in good faith in a reasonable and responsible manner including in connection with the loss or theft of your Device.

<p>Unless prohibited by law, the following limitations of liability apply. Service may be interrupted, delayed, or otherwise limited for a variety of reasons, including environmental conditions, unavailability of radio frequency channels, system capacity, priority access by National Security and Emergency Preparedness personnel in the event of a disaster or emergency, coordination with other systems, equipment modifications and repairs, and problems with the facilities of interconnecting carriers. We may block access to certain categories of numbers (e.g., 976, 900, and international destinations) at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>Additional hardware, software, subscription, credit or debit card, Internet access from your compatible PC and/or special network connection may be required and you are solely responsible for arranging for or obtaining all such requirements.

<p>Unless you subscribe to an Unlimited Voice Plan or are an upstate New York customer subscribing to Enhanced Voicemail, airtime charges apply to calls to your voicemail service, including calls where the caller does not leave a message, because the call has been completed, calls to listen to, send, reply to, or forward messages, or to perform other activities with your voicemail service, including calls forwarded from other phones to your voicemail service. You are solely responsible for establishing and maintaining security passwords to protect against unauthorized use of your voicemail service. For information as to the number of voicemail messages you can store, when voicemail messages will be deleted, and other voicemail features, see <a href="http://www.att.com/wirelessvoicemail" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>att.com/wirelessvoicemail</u></a>. We reserve the right to change the number of voicemails you can store, the length you can store voicemail messages, when we delete voicemail messages, and other voicemail features without notice. We may deactivate your voicemail service if you do not initialize it within a reasonable period after activation. We will reactivate the service upon your request. See <a href="http://www.att.com/global" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>att.com/global</u></a> for information about using voicemail internationally.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T is not responsible, nor liable for: 1) errors in the conversion of or its inability to transcribe voicemail messages to text/email; 2) lost or misdirected messages; or, 3) content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, obscene, tortious, or otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p>We do not filter, edit or control voice, text, or email messages, or guarantee the security of messages. We can interrupt, restrict or terminate VMTT without notice, if your use of VMTT adversely impacts AT&amp;T's network, for example that could occur from abnormal calling patterns or an unusually large number of repeated calls and messages; or if your use is otherwise abusive, fraudulent, or does not comply with the law.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws as to the content of any text messages or emails you receive from VMTT that you forward or include in a reply to any other person. You authorize AT&amp;T or a third party working on AT&amp;T's behalf to listen to, and transcribe all or part of a voicemail message and to convert such voicemail message into text/email, and to use voicemail messages and transcriptions to enhance, train and improve AT&amp;T's speech recognition and transcription services, software and equipment.</p>
<p>Charges for VMTT include the conversion of the voicemail message and the text message sent to your wireless device. Additional charges, however, may apply to receiving email on your wireless device from VMTT, as well as, replying to or forwarding VMTT messages via SMS (text) or email, depending on your plan.</p>
<p>SMS (text messaging) blocking is incompatible with VMTT. (If you do not have a texting plan on your handset, we add a texting pay per use feature when you add VMTT with text delivery.) If you are traveling outside the U.S. coverage area, you will incur international data charges for emails received from VMTT, as well as, charges for emails you respond to or forward from VMTT, unless you have an international data plan and the usage falls within the plan's usage limits.</p>
<p>Transcription times cannot be guaranteed. Customers purchasing email delivery are responsible for providing a correct email address and updating the email address when changes to the email account are made.</p>
<p>If you choose SMS (text) delivery, VMTT only converts the first 480 characters of a voicemail message into text and you will receive up to three text messages of a transcribed message. The transcription, therefore, may not include the entire voicemail message with SMS delivery. Adding VMTT will create a new voicemail box and all messages and greetings will be deleted from your current voicemail box.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T provides wireless data and messaging Services, including but not limited to, features that may be used with Data Services and wireless content and applications (&quot;Data Services&quot;). The absolute capacity of the wireless data network is limited; consequently, Data Services may only be used for permitted activities. Pricing and data allowances for Data Services are device dependent and based on the capabilities and capacity of each Device.</p>
<p><b>For Data Services with a monthly megabyte (MB) or gigabyte (GB) data allowance, once you exceed your monthly data allowance you will be automatically charged for overage as specified in the applicable rate plan. All data allowances, including overages, must be used in the billing period in which the allowance is provided. Unused data allowances will not roll over to subsequent billing periods.</b></p>
<p>AT&amp;T data plans are designed for use with only one of the following distinct Device types: (1) Smartphones, (2) basic and Quick Messaging phones, (3) tablets, (4) LaptopConnect cards, (5) stand-alone Mobile Hotspot devices, and (6) Home Bases. A data plan designated for one type of device may not be used with another type of device. For example, a data plan designated for use with a basic phone or a Smartphone may not be used with a LaptopConnect card, tablet, or stand-alone Mobile Hotspot device, by tethering devices together, by SIM card transfer, or any other means. A data tethering plan, however, may be purchased for an additional fee to enable tethering on a compatible device. An Activation Fee may apply for each data line.</p>
<p>Consumer data plans do not allow access to corporate email, company intranet sites, and other business applications. Access to corporate email, company intranet sites, and/or other business applications requires an applicable Enterprise Data plan. Enterprise Email requires an eligible data plan and Device. Terms may vary depending on selected Enterprise Email solution.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE YOUR DATA SERVICES WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, UPON EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF YOUR WIRELESS CUSTOMER AGREEMENT.</p>

Therefore, certain activities and uses of AT&amp;T’s wireless data service are permitted and others are prohibited. The terms and conditions of your use of AT&amp;T’s wireless data service are set forth below.</p>
<p><b>Permitted Activities.</b> AT&amp;T's wireless data services are intended to be used for the following permitted activities: (i) web browsing; (ii) email; and (iii) intranet access if permitted by your rate plan (for example, access to corporate intranets, email, and individual productivity applications like customer relationship management, sales force, and field service automation); (d) uploading and downloading applications and content to and from the Internet or third-party application stores, and (e) using applications and content without excessively contributing to network congestion.</p>

<p>The following specific uses of AT&amp;T's wireless data service are prohibited:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
<li>AT&amp;T’s wireless data services may <u>not</u> be used in any manner that defeats, obstructs or penetrates, or attempts to defeat, obstruct or penetrate the security measures of&nbsp;AT&amp;T’s wireless network or systems, or another entity’s network or systems; that accesses, or attempts to access without authority, the accounts of others; or that&nbsp;adversely affects the ability of other people or systems to use either AT&amp;T’s wireless services or other parties’ Internet-based resources. For example, this includes, but is not&nbsp;limited to, malicious software or “malware” that is designed, intentionally or unintentionally, to infiltrate a network or computer system such as spyware, worms, Trojan horses,&nbsp;rootkits, and/or crimeware; “denial of service” attacks against a network host or individual user; and “spam” or unsolicited commercial or bulk email (or activities that have the effect of facilitating unsolicited commercial email or unsolicited bulk e-mail).</li>
<li>AT&amp;T’s wireless data services may not be used in any manner that has the effect of excessively contributing to network congestion, hindering other customers’ access to the&nbsp;network, or degrading network performance by maintaining a sustained and continuous wireless data service connection or active wireless Internet connection. For example,&nbsp;this includes, but is not limited to, server devices or host computer applications such as continuous Web camera posts or broadcasts, automatic data feeds, or automated&nbsp;machine-to-machine connections; “auto-responders,” “cancel-bots,” or similar automated or manual routines that generate excessive amounts of traffic or that disrupt user<br>
groups or email use by others; use of the service as a substitute or backup for private lines or full-time or dedicated data connections; peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing services; and software or other devices that maintain continuous active Internet connections when a connection would otherwise be idle or any “keep alive” functions,&nbsp;unless they adhere to AT&amp;T data retry requirements (as may be modified from time to time).</li>
<li>AT&amp;T’s wireless data services also may <u>not</u> be used with high bandwidth applications, services and content that are not optimized to work with AT&amp;T's wireless data services&nbsp;and, therefore disproportionately and excessively contribute to network congestion. This includes, but is not limited to, redirecting television signals for viewing on&nbsp;computing devices, web broadcasting, and/or the operation of servers, telemetry devices, or supervisory control and data acquisition devices, unless they meet AT&amp;T's&nbsp;wireless data services optimization requirements.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>You agree not to use AT&amp;T’s wireless data services for any of these prohibited activities.</p>
<p><b>AT&amp;T’s Rights to Ensure Compliance.</b> You agree that AT&amp;T has the right to take any and all actions necessary to enforce this Section 6.2 if you use AT&amp;T’s wireless data services in any manner that is prohibited, including, but not limited to, the following actions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
<li>AT&amp;T may modify, without advance notice, the permitted and prohibited activities, and the optimization requirements for your wireless data services;</li>
<li>AT&amp;T may engage in any reasonable network management practice to enhance customer service, to reduce network congestion, to adapt to advances and changes in&nbsp;technology, and/or to respond to the availability of wireless bandwidth and spectrum;</li>
<li>AT&amp;T may reduce your data throughput speeds at any time or place if your data usage exceeds an applicable, identified usage threshold during any billing cycle. AT&amp;T will&nbsp;provide you with advance notice of the usage threshold applicable to your data plan, or any changes to the applicable usage threshold either by a bill insert, email, text&nbsp;&nbsp;message or other appropriate means;</li>
<li>AT&amp;T may use reasonable methods to monitor and collect customer usage information to better optimize the operation of the network. Details concerning the information that&nbsp;AT&amp;T collects about its customers, and how it uses and protects that information are addressed in the AT&amp;T Privacy Policy (see <a href="http://www.att.com/privacy" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>att.com/privacy</u>)</a>;</li>
<li>If you are an AT&amp;T unlimited data plan customer, AT&amp;T may migrate you from the unlimited data plan to a tiered data plan and bill you the appropriate monthly fees. We will provide you with notice of this change at least one billing cycle in advance either by a bill insert, email, text message, or other appropriate means;</li>
<li>AT&amp;T may interrupt, suspend, cancel or terminate your wireless data services without advance notice.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Unlimited Data Customers.</b> If you are a grandfathered AT&amp;T unlimited plan data service customer, you agree that “unlimited” means you pay a fixed monthly charge for wireless data service regardless of how much data you use. You further agree that “unlimited” does <u>not</u> mean that you can use AT&amp;T’s wireless data service in any way that you choose or for any prohibited activities, and that if you use your unlimited data plan in any manner that is prohibited, AT&amp;T can limit, restrict, suspend or terminate your data service or switch you to a tiered data plan.</p>

<p>A voice plan is required on all voice-capable Devices, unless specifically noted otherwise in the terms governing your plan.</p>
<p>An eligible tiered pricing data plan is required for certain Devices, including iPhones and other designated Smartphones. Eligible voice and tiered pricing data plans cover voice and data usage in the U.S. and do not cover International voice and data usage and charges. If it is determined that you are using a voice-capable Device without a voice plan, or that you are using an iPhone or designated Smartphone without an eligible voice and tiered data plan, AT&amp;T reserves the right to switch you to the required plan or plans and bill you the appropriate monthly fees. In the case of the tiered data plan, you will be placed on the data plan which provides you with the greatest monthly data usage allowance. If you determine that you do not require that much data usage in a month, you may request a lower data tier at a lower monthly recurring fee.</p>

<p>DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE OCCURS WHENEVER YOUR DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK AND IS ENGAGED IN ANY DATA TRANSMISSION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (i) SENDING OR RECEIVING EMAIL, DOCUMENTS, OR OTHER CONTENT, (ii) ACCESSING WEBSITES, OR (iii) DOWNLOADING AND USING APPLICATIONS. SOME APPLICATIONS, CONTENT, PROGRAMS, AND SOFTWARE THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR THAT COMES PRE-LOADED ON YOUR DEVICE AUTOMATICALLY AND REGULARLY SEND AND RECEIVE DATA TRANSMISSIONS IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, WITHOUT YOU AFFIRMATIVELY INITIATING THE REQUEST AND WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE. FOR EXAMPLE, APPLICATIONS THAT PROVIDE REAL-TIME INFORMATION AND LOCATION-BASED APPLICATIONS CONNECT TO OUR NETWORK, AND SEND AND RECEIVE UPDATED INFORMATION SO THAT IT IS AVAILABLE TO YOU WHEN YOU WANT TO ACCESS IT. IN ADDITION, ANY ADVERTISEMENTS OR ADVERTISER-RELATED MESSAGES OR DATA DELIVERED TO YOUR DEVICE, EVEN IF DELIVERED TO AN APPLICATION, AS WELL AS ANY MESSAGES OR CONTENT THAT INITIATE IN RESPONSE TO AN ADVERTISEMENT, WILL COUNT TOWARD YOUR DATA USAGE. YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR ALL DATA TRANSPORT AND USAGE WHEN YOUR DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK, INCLUDING THAT WHICH YOU AFFIRMATIVELY INITIATE OR THAT WHICH RUNS AUTOMATICALLY IN THE BACKGROUND WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, AND WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. A DATA SESSION INITIATED ON THE AT&amp;T NETWORK WILL CONTINUE ITS CONNECTION OVER THE AT&amp;T NETWORK UNTIL THE DATA TRANSMISSION IS CONCLUDED, EVEN WHEN YOU CONNECT TO A WI-FI NETWORK DURING THE TRANSMISSION.</p>
<p>Unless designated for International or Canada use, prices and included use apply to access and use on AT&amp;T's wireless network and the wireless networks of other companies with which AT&amp;T has a contractual relationship within the United States and its territories (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), excluding areas within the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Usage on networks not owned by AT&amp;T is limited as provided in your data plan. Charges will be based on the location of the site receiving and transmitting service and not the location of the subscriber. Mobile Broadband and 4G access requires a compatible device.</p>
<p>Data Service charges paid in advance for monthly or annual Data Services are nonrefundable. Some Data Services may require an additional monthly subscription fee and/or be subject to additional charges and restrictions. Prices do not include taxes, directory assistance, roaming, universal services fees or other surcharges.</p>
<p>In order to assess your usage during an applicable billing period, you may obtain approximate usage information by calling customer service or using one of our automated systems.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T Mobile Share plans, including Mobile Share Value plans, allow you to share a monthly allotment of domestic wireless data usage, along with unlimited domestic talk and texting services among up to ten (10) Devices. You choose a specific allotment of monthly shared data usage for a monthly recurring charge and then pay an additional charge for each Device added to the Mobile Share plan you select. You must specifically identify the devices (the “Designated Devices”) that will share your monthly allotment of data usage under the Mobile Share plan you select. If you add a WHP Device for unlimited talk only, it will be counted as one of the (10) Designated Devices under the Mobile Share plan. Designated Devices can include: smartphone(s), tablet(s), gaming device(s), modem(s), netbook(s), laptop(s), mobile hotspot(s), basic or quick messaging phone(s), WHP Device(s) or Home Base(s). If, during a billing period, your data usage exceeds the monthly allotment of data in the Mobile Share plan you select, plus any other data (such as available Rollover Data) that you may have for use during the billing period, you will automatically be charged for overage as specified in your rate plan. Unless specified otherwise, data allowances, including overages and Rollover Data, must be used in the billing period provided or you will forfeit that usage. Authorized users on the account may temporarily suspend data access for particular Device(s) during a specific billing cycle, but monthly charges for the suspended Device(s) will continue to apply. Tethering and/or mobile hotspot use is permitted with Mobile Share plans with capable Designated Devices; provided, however, that such use is limited to a maximum of five (5) simultaneous users per Device. An activation fee will be charged when converting from a prepaid or Session-Based plan to a Mobile Share plan or when you activate an additional Device on an existing Mobile Share plan. Access to corporate email, intranet sites and/or other business applications may be available for an additional monthly charge per Device (no additional charge for Mobile Share Value plans). Discounts otherwise applicable to your Mobile Share rate plan do not apply to the additional monthly Device charge. Additional deposits and other restrictions may apply.</p>
<p><b>Rollover Data</b><sup>SM</sup>: Only Mobile Share Value® plans include the Rollover Data feature. With Rollover Data, unused data from the monthly plan allotment rounds up to the nearest MB and carries over for one billing period. <b>Unused Rollover Data automatically expires after one billing period or with any plan change (such as changing data amounts or termination).</b> Unused overage data does not roll over. Rollover Data is always consumed last, after your other data allowances. Unused Rollover Data is not redeemable for cash or credit and is not transferable including to other Mobile Share Value groups on your account. Mobile Share and Mobile Share Data-only plans do not include Rollover Data.</p>
<p>If you use a Mobile Share plan with any device that is not a Designated Data Device, for tethering or as a mobile hotspot with more than five (5) simultaneous users, or otherwise use the plan in any way that is inconsistent with its terms, you agree that AT&amp;T may: (a) suspend or terminate service to the account; (b) place any non-complying Device on an appropriate Mobile Share plan; and/or (c) add any other required element of the plan.</p>
<p><b>Device upgrades</b>: If you upgrade to a new smartphone, a discounted access charge is only available for that line when purchasing a new smartphone via AT&amp;T Next<sup>SM</sup> or when you bring your own smartphone or you purchase a new smartphone at full retail price. If you upgrade your Device to a new smartphone on a 2-year Service Commitment, that line is ineligible for the discount and the discount is lost.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T Mobile Share - Data plans allow you to share a monthly allotment of domestic wireless data usage among up to ten (10) 3G, HSPA+ or LTE Devices (excluding smartphones and basic or quick messaging phones). You choose a specific allotment of monthly shared data usage for a monthly recurring charge and then pay an additional charge for each Device added to the Mobile Share - Data plan you select. You must specifically identify one or more eligible devices (the “Designated Data Devices”) that will share your monthly allotment of data usage under the Mobile Share - Data plan you select. Designated Data Devices can include: tablet(s), gaming device(s), modem(s), netbook(s), laptop(s), or mobile hotspot(s). If, during a billing period, your data usage exceeds the monthly allotment of data in the Mobile Share - Data plan you select, you will automatically be charged for overage as specified in your rate plan. If, during a billing period, you do not use all of the data allotment in the Mobile Share - Data plan you select, you will forfeit that usage. Authorized users on the account may temporarily suspend data access for particular Designated Data Device(s) during a specific billing cycle, but monthly charges for the suspended Designated Data Device(s) will continue to apply. Tethering and/or mobile hotspot use is permitted with Mobile Share – Data plans with capable Designated Data Devices; provided, however, that such use is limited to a maximum of five (5) simultaneous users per Designated Data Device. An activation fee will be charged when converting from a prepaid or Session-Based plan to a Mobile Share - Data plan or when you activate an additional Designated Data Device on an existing Mobile Share - Data plan. Designated Data Devices that are capable of accessing corporate email, intranet sites and/or other business applications may do so for no additional monthly access charge. Discounts otherwise applicable to your Mobile Share - Data rate plan do not apply to the additional monthly Device charge. Additional deposits and other restrictions may apply.</p>
<p>If you use a Mobile Share - Data plan with a smartphone, with any device that is not a Designated Data Device, for tethering or as a mobile hotspot with more than five (5) simultaneous users, or otherwise use the plan in any way that is inconsistent with its terms, you agree that AT&amp;T may: (a) suspend or terminate service to the account; (b) place any non-complying Device on an appropriate Mobile Share plan; and/or (c) add any other required element of the plan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 20px;"><p><a name="wirelessHomePhone" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>AT&amp;T Wireless Home Phone Service</u></b></p>
<p>AT&amp;T Wireless Home Phone (&quot;WHP&quot;) service utilizes mobile wireless gateway Equipment called an AT&amp;T Wireless Home Phone device (&quot;WHP Device&quot;) to which you connect a landline phone to place and receive calls over the AT&amp;T wireless network. See Section 3.2 for more information about how AT&amp;T wireless service works.</p>
<p>WHP service provides voice service only and requires that you subscribe to one of the following eligible wireless voice plan options: (1) Wireless Home Phone unlimited plan, (2) add a line to your FamilyTalk plan, or (3) add a WHP Device to your AT&amp;T Mobile Share plan. If your WHP Device is used to roam on other carrier networks, AT&amp;T's off-net usage restrictions apply. Text messaging, data services, features and international roaming are not supported by WHP service. If you use a wireless voice plan not designed for WHP service with your WHP Device, AT&amp;T reserves the right to switch you to an appropriate plan and bill you the associated fees for such plan.</p>
<p>911 calls are routed based on the wireless network's automatic location technology. You should expect to provide your location address to the emergency response center responsible for sending first responders (e.g. police, medical assistance, or fire) to your location. The WHP Device has battery backup power and will work in the event of a power outage. However, if you connect a landline phone to the WHP Device that itself requires external electric power to operate (e.g., a cordless phone), you will not be able to place and receive calls over that phone during a power outage.</p>

<p><a name="wirelessHomePhoneInternet" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"></a><b>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Wireless Home Phone and Internet Service</u></b></p>
<p>AT&amp;T Wireless Home Phone and Internet (&quot;WHPI&quot;) service utilizes mobile wireless gateway Equipment called an AT&amp;T Home Base (&quot;Home Base&quot;). The Home Base allows you to connect a landline phone to place and receive calls, and to connect up to eleven (11) Internet-capable devices (one (1) via Ethernet and ten (10) via Wi-Fi) to have mobile broadband Internet access over the AT&amp;T wireless network. See Section 3.2 for more information about how AT&amp;T wireless service works.</p>
<p>WHPI service requires that you subscribe to an eligible wireless voice and/or data plan to take advantage of one or both capabilities. Voice plan options include either a Home Base unlimited plan, or a line added to your FamilyTalk plan. Tiered data plan options allow you to share a monthly allotment of domestic wireless data usage among your connected internet-capable devices. If your data usage exceeds the monthly data allotment of the plan you select during a billing period, you automatically will be charged for overages as specified in your plan. If you do not use all of the monthly data allotment of the plan you select during a billing period, you forfeit that usage. You may also add your Home Base to your AT&amp;T Mobile Share plan if the monthly allotment of domestic wireless data usage under your AT&amp;T Mobile Share plan is 10 GB or more.</p>
<p>If your Home Base is used to roam on other carrier networks, AT&amp;T's off-net usage restrictions apply. Messaging services and international roaming are not supported by WHPI service. If you use a wireless voice and/or data plan not designed for WHPI service with your Home Base, AT&amp;T reserves the right to switch you to an appropriate plan and bill you the associated fees for such plan.</p>
<p>911 calls are routed based on the wireless network's automatic location technology. You should expect to provide your location address to the emergency response center responsible for sending first responders (e.g. police, medical assistance, or fire) to your location. The Home Base has battery backup power and will work in the event of a power outage. However, if you connect a landline phone to the Home Base that itself requires external electric power to operate (e.g., a cordless phone), you will not be able to place and receive calls over that phone during a power outage.</p>

<b><b><p>You are not liable for charges you did not authorize, but the fact that a call was placed from your Device is evidence that the call was authorized. Unauthorized charges may include calls made to or from your phone or other Device after it was lost or stolen. Once you report to us that the Device is lost or stolen and your Device is suspended, you will not be responsible for subsequent charges incurred by that Device. You can report your Device as lost or stolen and suspend Services without a charge by contacting us at the phone number listed on your bill or at <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com" target="_blank" data-cqpath="/content/att/legal/terms/jcr:content;2015187"><u>wireless.att.com</u></a>.</p>
<p>If you notify us of any charges on your bill you claim are unauthorized, we will investigate. If there are charges on your bill for calls made after the Device was lost or stolen, but before you reported it to us, notify us of the disputed charges and we will investigate. You may submit documents, statements and other information to show any charges were not authorized. We will advise you of the result of our investigation within 30 days. If you do not agree with the outcome, you may file a complaint with the California Public Utilities Commission and you may have other legal rights. While an investigation is underway, you do not have to pay any charges you dispute or associated late charges, and we will not send the disputed amount to collection or file an adverse credit report about it. While your phone is suspended you will remain responsible for complying with all other obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to, your monthly fee. We both have a duty to act in good faith and in a reasonable and responsible manner including in connection with the loss or theft of your Device.</p>
