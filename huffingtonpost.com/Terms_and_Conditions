                use of or reliance on any content, goods or services available on or through such services.
9. We May be Legally Compelled to Disclose Certain Information: You agree that in 
                the event we receive a subpoena issued by a court or from a law enforcement or government 
                agency, we shall comply with such subpoenas without your consent or prior notice to you 
                and may disclose your IP address, username, name, IP location or other information 
                in response thereto.
10. Our Liability to You is Limited: The Huffington Post and its affiliates, 
                and their respective members, directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders,
