                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                

<p><i>Last Updated: May 14, 2015</i></p>

<p>These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) are an agreement between you, a user
(&ldquo;Participant&rdquo;) of the Gratipay service (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), and Gratipay, LLC
(&ldquo;Gratipay&rdquo;). They govern your use of the Service and your relationship with
Gratipay. When you register as a Gratipay Participant, you agree to be bound by
these Terms.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us:</p>

<p>Gratipay, LLC<br>
716 Park Road<br>
Ambridge, PA 15003<br>
USA<br>

<ol>
<li><p>Registration, Security, and Privacy</p>

<ol>
<li>When you register for the Service, you agree to provide Gratipay with
complete and accurate registration information. You are responsible for
keeping your account information, including your contact and payment
information, up to date. Gratipay takes our Participants&#39; privacy seriously. We
will only use or share your information and Content as described in our
<a href="/about/policies/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these
Terms.</li>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
information, including your authentication credentials. You agree to
notify Gratipay immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or
unauthorized use of your credentials. Gratipay shall not be liable for any loss
or damage arising from your failure to keep your account secure.</li>
<li>You may only use the Service if you are 13 years old or older, and you
represent to us that you are 13 or older. If you are under the age of 18,
your legal guardian must consent to your use and must agree to be bound by
these Terms.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The Gratipay Model and General Rules</p>

<ol>
<li>The Service is a platform to enable Teams of Gratipay Participants to
receive payments to fund Open Work. Open Work means that the Team provides
a clear path for any individual to voluntarily begin contributing to the Team&#39;s
work and to share in any revenue the Team generates. Some examples of Teams
performing Open Work include an open source software project that pays
contributors, or a hackerspace that pays individuals to teach classes or manage
its operations.</li>
<li>The Participant who establishes a Team is its Owner. Teams may optionally
have other Members.</li>
<li>When you establish a Team on the Service to fund your Open Work, you agree
that payments will be used exclusively to support the Open Work described
in your Team&#39;s profile.</li>
<li>When you make a payment to a Team, it is a payment to fund the Open Work
the Team provides. You understand and acknowledge that your payment does
not entitle you personally to receive any goods or services from the Team,
unless the Team explicitly offers those things to Participants.</li>
<li>By accepting a payment from a Participant, a Team forms an agreement with
that Participant to perform the Open Work described in its profile. The
Service is a platform to facilitate this agreement. Gratipay is not a party to
the agreement, and is not responsible to either the Team or the Participant if
either party breaches the terms of the agreement (e.g. if the Team fails to
provide the promised services).</li>
<li>Gratipay is not obligated to provide refunds under any circumstance. Teams
are responsible for producing the Open Work they offer. Gratipay does not
hold funds on behalf of Teams, and does not warrant or guarantee that Teams
will provide the Open Work they promise.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Payroll Rules</p>

<ol>
<li>Teams can use the Service&#39;s Payroll feature to automatically divide
incoming payments among Team Members, according to the allocation set by
the Owner and/or Members.</li>
<li>Gratipay does not determine how a Team&#39;s Payroll is allocated and is not
responsible for how Teams internally distribute payments. The agreement
between Team Members and Owners regarding the allocation of payments is solely
between those parties.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Rules for Gratipay Teams</p>

<ol>
<li>Teams may accept payments on the Service only for Open Work, meaning that
they provide a clear path for any individual to voluntarily begin
contributing to the Team&#39;s work, and to share in any revenue the Team
generates.</li>
<li>A Team can only begin receiving payments from Participants once it has
provided a working withdrawal mechanism for receiving payments (e.g. bank
account information).</li>
<li>Teams and their Open Work must be consistent with Gratipay&#39;s <a href="http://inside.gratipay.com/big-picture/brand/">Brand
Guidelines</a> and Acceptable
Use Policy.</li>
<li>Gratipay reserves the right to reject, suspend, or remove a Team at any
time, and for any reason.</li>
<li>Establishing a Team on Gratipay involves an application and approval
process. As part of this process, the Gratipay community will have the
opportunity to publicly evaluate and provide commentary about the Team.
However, all decisions regarding whether to accept, reject, suspend, remove, or
take any other action regarding a Team belong solely to Gratipay.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Fees and Taxes</p>

<ol>
<li>Gratipay does not take any fee from payments made by Participants to
Teams. Gratipay and the Service are funded through the Service itself, by
voluntary contributions from Gratipay Participants and Teams who wish to fund
our own Open Work. To contribute to Gratipay, please <a href="/Gratipay/">visit Gratipay&#39;s Team
page</a>.</li>
<li>You are responsible for paying any third-party fees associated with your
use of the Service, such as credit card and bank fees.</li>
<li>You are responsible for paying any taxes and withholdings associated with
your use of the Service. Team Owners, and not Gratipay, are responsible
for compliance with all laws, as well as any taxes and withholding
requirements, applicable to payments made to Team Members (whether through the
Payroll feature or otherwise), including without limitation payroll tax,
unemployment insurance, and worker compensation insurance payments. Team Owners
are also responsible for providing any required tax and other documentation to
employees, independent contractors, tax authorities, or any other person.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Content Accessible on the Service</p>

<ol>
<li>With the exception of content provided by Participants of the Service, the
contents of Gratipay.com&mdash;including all text, images, data, software,
and audio&mdash;are dedicated to the public domain according to the terms of
the CC0 1.0
Universal Public Domain Dedication.</li>
<li>All content accessible through the Service is the sole responsibility of
the person who provides it, and Gratipay is not responsible for content
provided by any Participant or third party. We do not represent or warrant the
truthfulness, reliability, or accuracy of any content, or that the content does
not infringe the rights of third parties. Gratipay shall not be responsible for
any loss or damage arising out of your access to, use of, or reliance on the
content.</li>
<li>Gratipay reserves the right to remove content for any reason, including
that it violates our Acceptable Use Policy. The Service may allow
Participants to flag or report graphic, abusive, or otherwise objectionable
content, and Gratipay may disable or filter access to flagged or reported
content. However, Gratipay has no obligation to monitor, filter, or disable
access to any content, and shall not be responsible if you encounter
objectionable content by using the Service.</li>
<li>The Service, including Participant and Team profiles, may contain links to
other websites. When you access third-party websites linked to from the
Service, you do so at your own risk. Gratipay does not review, control, or
endorse those sites.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>License to Your Content</p>

<ol>
<li>You retain your rights to any content you provide through the Service.

perform, distribute, transmit, adapt, and modify the content, in all media now
known or later developed. </li>
<li>This license permits Gratipay to operate, promote, and improve the
Service, and to develop new Service. It also permits Gratipay to provide,
publish, or syndicate the content to third parties, for example by providing
for the embedding of content on other services.</li>
<li>You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and authority
to grant this license to Gratipay. With regard to any third-party content
that you submit, you represent and warrant that you have a license to provide
the content according to these Terms, or that your use is otherwise
permissible, for example as fair use.</li>
</ol></li>

OTHER PARTICIPANTS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE
SERVICE; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS
OR CONTENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF GRATIPAY OR ITS
AFFILIATES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE
AMOUNT YOU PAID GRATIPAY, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICE GIVING

</ol></li>
<li><p>Indemnification</p>

<ol>
<li>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Gratipay and its
officers, directors, employees, contractors and agents from and against
any and all claims, causes of action, damages, obligations, losses,
liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including attorneys&#39; fees and costs)
and all amounts paid in settlement arising from or relating to use of the
Service, breach of these Terms or violation of any laws. Gratipay may assume
the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you have agreed to
indemnify Gratipay and you agree to assist and cooperate with Gratipay in the
defense or settlement of any such matters.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Miscellaneous Terms</p>

<ol>
<li>Assignment: You may not assign your rights and obligations under these
Terms to any other person. In the event of a merger, sale, or acquisition
of substantially all of Gratipay&#39;s assets, Gratipay may assign its rights and
obligations under these Terms to its successor except with Gratipay&#39;s express
written agreement.</li>
<li>Modifications to this Agreement: Gratipay may occasionally revise these
Terms. You can find the most recent version at
<a href="http://gratipay.com/about/terms/">http://gratipay.com/about/terms/</a>. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that
a change to these Terms is material, we will notify you of the change through
the Service or by emailing you at the address associated with your account. By
using the Service after a new version of these Terms becomes effective, you
thereby agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</li>
<li>Choice of Law: These Terms and the relationship between you and Gratipay
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania without regard
to its conflict of law provisions. Any and all claims, causes of action, or
disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the Service,
shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in Beaver County,
Pennsylvania, or the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania. You consent and waive any objection to the jurisdiction of and
venue in these courts.</li>
<li>Authority to Enter Into Agreement: You represent and warrant that you have
the legal authority to enter into this agreement and that the performance
of obligations under this agreement will not violate any agreement between you
and any other person, firm, or organization. If you are entering this agreement
on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you are
authorized to do so.</li>
<li>Export Controls: You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not
located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that
has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &ldquo;terrorist supporting&rdquo; country;
and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or
restricted parties.</li>
<li>Waiver and Severability: Failure by Gratipay to enforce any right or
provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or
provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid
or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will
remain in full force and effect.</li>
<li>Entire Agreement: These Terms and our <a href="/about/policies/privacy">Privacy
Policy</a> together form the entire and exclusive
agreement between you and Gratipay regarding the Service (excluding any service
for which you have a separate agreement with Gratipay that is explicitly in
addition to or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace
any prior agreements between you and Gratipay regarding the Service. There
shall be no third-party beneficiaries to the Terms.</li>
