Privacy Policy
Last Updated: October 29, 2014
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information is
collected, used and disclosed by Gratipay, LLC and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies ("Gratipay"). This Policy applies to the websites of
Gratipay, including https://gratipay.com/ ("Sites") and
Gratipay's other products, services or any other features, technologies or
functionalities offered by us on our Sites or through any other means
(collectively, "Services"). This Policy does not apply to information you
provide directly to third party websites or third party applications that use
Gratipay's Services.  We do not control the activities of such third parties
and advise you to consult their privacy policies before you share your personal
information.
Personal Information Collected
We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Sites and
Services. For example, we collect information you provide to us when you
register for a Gratipay account, initiate or accept a gift, request customer
service or respond to a Gratipay survey. Such personal information may include
your name, address, email address, credit card information and bank account and
routing numbers.  Before you use the Services, we may also require you to
provide additional information that we can use to verify your identity, such as
your date of birth, Social Security number or other information.  Finally, we
may obtain information about you from other sources, including third party
websites or applications that offer the Gratipay Services, and combine that with
information we collect on our Sites and through our Services.
When you visit our Sites or use our Services, some information is
automatically collected. For example, when you visit our Sites, your computer's
operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times, browser type
and language and the website you visited before our Sites are logged
automatically. We also collect information about your usage and activity on our
Sites and Services.

other things, cookies help us improve our Sites, Services and your experience.
We use browser cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count

this could affect certain features or services of our Sites or Services. Please
note that you may also encounter cookies from third parties when using the
Gratipay Services on websites that we do not control.
Web Beacons. We may also collect information using Web beacons. Web
beacons are electronic images that may be used on our Sites, in our Services or

usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and
acted upon.

purposes described in this Policy or otherwise disclosed to you. For example,
we may use personal information to:

    including confirmations, receipts, invoices, technical notices, updates,

Sharing of Personal Information
