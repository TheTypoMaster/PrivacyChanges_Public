Terms of Service
Last Updated: May 14, 2015
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are an agreement between you, a user
(“Participant”) of the Gratipay service (the “Service”), and Gratipay, LLC
(“Gratipay”). They govern your use of the Service and your relationship with
Gratipay. When you register as a Gratipay Participant, you agree to be bound by
these Terms.
If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us:
Gratipay, LLC
716 Park Road
Ambridge, PA 15003
USA

Registration, Security, and Privacy

When you register for the Service, you agree to provide Gratipay with
complete and accurate registration information. You are responsible for
keeping your account information, including your contact and payment
information, up to date. Gratipay takes our Participants' privacy seriously. We
will only use or share your information and Content as described in our
Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these
Terms.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
information, including your authentication credentials. You agree to
notify Gratipay immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or
unauthorized use of your credentials. Gratipay shall not be liable for any loss
or damage arising from your failure to keep your account secure.
You may only use the Service if you are 13 years old or older, and you
represent to us that you are 13 or older. If you are under the age of 18,
your legal guardian must consent to your use and must agree to be bound by
these Terms.

The Gratipay Model and General Rules

The Service is a platform to enable Teams of Gratipay Participants to
receive payments to fund Open Work. Open Work means that the Team provides
a clear path for any individual to voluntarily begin contributing to the Team's
work and to share in any revenue the Team generates. Some examples of Teams
performing Open Work include an open source software project that pays
contributors, or a hackerspace that pays individuals to teach classes or manage
its operations.
The Participant who establishes a Team is its Owner. Teams may optionally
have other Members.
When you establish a Team on the Service to fund your Open Work, you agree
that payments will be used exclusively to support the Open Work described
in your Team's profile.
When you make a payment to a Team, it is a payment to fund the Open Work
the Team provides. You understand and acknowledge that your payment does
not entitle you personally to receive any goods or services from the Team,
unless the Team explicitly offers those things to Participants.
By accepting a payment from a Participant, a Team forms an agreement with
that Participant to perform the Open Work described in its profile. The
Service is a platform to facilitate this agreement. Gratipay is not a party to
the agreement, and is not responsible to either the Team or the Participant if
either party breaches the terms of the agreement (e.g. if the Team fails to
provide the promised services).
Gratipay is not obligated to provide refunds under any circumstance. Teams
are responsible for producing the Open Work they offer. Gratipay does not
hold funds on behalf of Teams, and does not warrant or guarantee that Teams
will provide the Open Work they promise.

Payroll Rules

Teams can use the Service's Payroll feature to automatically divide
incoming payments among Team Members, according to the allocation set by
the Owner and/or Members.
Gratipay does not determine how a Team's Payroll is allocated and is not
responsible for how Teams internally distribute payments. The agreement
between Team Members and Owners regarding the allocation of payments is solely
between those parties.

Rules for Gratipay Teams

Teams may accept payments on the Service only for Open Work, meaning that
they provide a clear path for any individual to voluntarily begin
contributing to the Team's work, and to share in any revenue the Team
generates.
A Team can only begin receiving payments from Participants once it has
provided a working withdrawal mechanism for receiving payments (e.g. bank
account information).
Teams and their Open Work must be consistent with Gratipay's Brand
Guidelines and Acceptable
Use Policy.
Gratipay reserves the right to reject, suspend, or remove a Team at any
time, and for any reason.
Establishing a Team on Gratipay involves an application and approval
process. As part of this process, the Gratipay community will have the
opportunity to publicly evaluate and provide commentary about the Team.
However, all decisions regarding whether to accept, reject, suspend, remove, or
take any other action regarding a Team belong solely to Gratipay.

Fees and Taxes

Gratipay does not take any fee from payments made by Participants to
Teams. Gratipay and the Service are funded through the Service itself, by
voluntary contributions from Gratipay Participants and Teams who wish to fund
our own Open Work. To contribute to Gratipay, please visit Gratipay's Team
page.
You are responsible for paying any third-party fees associated with your
use of the Service, such as credit card and bank fees.
You are responsible for paying any taxes and withholdings associated with
your use of the Service. Team Owners, and not Gratipay, are responsible
for compliance with all laws, as well as any taxes and withholding
requirements, applicable to payments made to Team Members (whether through the
Payroll feature or otherwise), including without limitation payroll tax,
unemployment insurance, and worker compensation insurance payments. Team Owners
are also responsible for providing any required tax and other documentation to
employees, independent contractors, tax authorities, or any other person.

All content accessible through the Service is the sole responsibility of
the person who provides it, and Gratipay is not responsible for content

truthfulness, reliability, or accuracy of any content, or that the content does
not infringe the rights of third parties. Gratipay shall not be responsible for
any loss or damage arising out of your access to, use of, or reliance on the
content.
Gratipay reserves the right to remove content for any reason, including
that it violates our Acceptable Use Policy. The Service may allow
Participants to flag or report graphic, abusive, or otherwise objectionable
content, and Gratipay may disable or filter access to flagged or reported
content. However, Gratipay has no obligation to monitor, filter, or disable
access to any content, and shall not be responsible if you encounter
objectionable content by using the Service.
The Service, including Participant and Team profiles, may contain links to
other websites. When you access third-party websites linked to from the
Service, you do so at your own risk. Gratipay does not review, control, or
endorse those sites.

This license permits Gratipay to operate, promote, and improve the
Service, and to develop new Service. It also permits Gratipay to provide,
publish, or syndicate the content to third parties, for example by providing

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and authority
to grant this license to Gratipay. With regard to any third-party content
that you submit, you represent and warrant that you have a license to provide
the content according to these Terms, or that your use is otherwise
permissible, for example as fair use.

please send us a notice containing the following information: a)

Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification

If you believe that content you posted was wrongfully removed or

address, telephone number, and email address; c) a statement that you consent
to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in
which your address is located (or the federal district courts located in the
Western District of Pennsylvania if your address is outside of the United
States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who
provided the original notification of infringement (or an agent of that
person); this statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good
