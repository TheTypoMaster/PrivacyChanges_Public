Etiquette








Skype is a community, and members of a community must respect each other as human beings. Skype therefore asks you not to get involved in any unwanted profane, offensive, obscene or sexual exchanges or to attempt to harm a young person in any way.
Please go to Inhope’s site if you would like information on reporting illegal use and content on the internet.
Skype asks that you do not:

Use vulgar, profane, offensive or obscene language.
Post or request sexually explicit images or other offensive content.
Exploit a minor in any way.
Use racially, religiously or sexually offensive language.
Discuss illegal activity, such as how to get drugs and how to make bombs.
Ask for or offer sexually explicit images, and/or material harmful to children.
Harass, threaten, embarrass, or do anything else to another Skype user that is unwanted.
Infringe anyone else's intellectual property rights, including but not limited to any copyright, trademark, rights of publicity, or other proprietary rights.
Impersonate or represent Skype.
Link to content not allowed on Skype.com.
Try and get a Skype’s member's password or other account information.
Post or request personal or other information from a minor (any person under the age of 18).
