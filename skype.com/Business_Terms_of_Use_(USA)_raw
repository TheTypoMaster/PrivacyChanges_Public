Emergency Calls</b></h2> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>2.1 No Emergency Calls. </b>The Skype Software does not support any emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any type of emergency services of any kind, except in the very limited circumstances described in paragraph 2.3 below. Skype is not a traditional telephone service or a replacement for Your primary telephone service. There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Skype Software and the Skype Products. You need to make additional arrangements in order to access emergency services. It is Your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Skype Software and the Skype Products, traditional wireless or fixed line telephone services that offer access to emergency services. It is Your responsibility to inform Your Users that it is not possible to support or carry emergency calls using the Skype Software and the Skype Products, and that they may access emergency services via the additional arrangements that You have made available to Your Users.</p> <p><b>2.2 Not a Standalone Service. </b>Business Products that enable communications via Your PBX and any other certified Skype Connect equipment should not be used as a standalone service but as a secondary communications channel only in connection with traditional telephone services. When using Business Products You shall configure Your PBX and any other certified Skype Connect equipment so that all emergency calls are placed through a standard landline connection or some other type of telephone services that support emergency calling.</p> <p><b>2.3 Limited Emergency Calling:</b> Skype will use reasonable endeavors to provide limited emergency calling in a very limited number of countries, and only where a Managed Account is being used for Individual Use by a Managed Account User who is using the Skype Software version 4.1 for Windows (or later) or version 3.0 for Mac OS X (or later) (&ldquo;Enabled Versions&rdquo;). Skype does not provide emergency calling for or in conjunction with any Business Products, Skype Products or on any platforms, devices or operating systems other than those Enabled Versions explicitly referred to in this paragraph 2.3. The following limitations apply in respect of emergency calling on Enabled Versions:</p> <p><b>2.3.1</b> Skype cannot guarantee that the emergency calling will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections, or at all. Where enabled, emergency calling will be transmitted through public Internet lines and the public switched telephone network (&quot;PSTN&quot;). Consequently, there may be power outages or Internet service disruption and You may experience some disruptions e.g. packet loss and delay which will interfere with the quality of Your communication. Furthermore, Skype cannot guarantee that You or Your Managed Account Users will always be able to communicate with other people, nor can Skype guarantee that You or Your Managed Account Users can communicate without disruptions, delays or communication-related flaws or that all Your communications shall always be delivered to other people. Any of these limitations may adversely affect successful call connection</p> <p><b>2.3.2 </b>An emergency call made using the Enabled Versions of Skype Software, in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.</p> <p><b>2.3.3</b> If the emergency call of a Managed Account User is connected, such Managed Account User will be required orally to provide their physical location to a third party emergency services operative to enable the correct emergency organization to respond to the emergency. If the Managed Account User does not provide this information when prompted, You acknowledge that the emergency call of Your Managed Account User may not be completed and such Managed Account User will not be able to gain access to the required emergency service using their Managed Account. Skype will have no liability for any failed emergency call in such circumstances.</p> <p><b>2.3.4</b> You expressly acknowledge the service limitations described above and agree to continue to make alternative arrangements in order for Your Managed Account Users to access emergency services through a traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone service, and only use emergency calling in the Enabled Versions of Skype Software as an absolute last resort.</p> <p><b>2.3.5</b> You can find out whether limited emergency calling functionality is available in the country in which Your Managed Account Users are located by setting the default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of the applicable Managed Account that is using one of the Enabled Versions of the Skype Software. It is Your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if the physical address of Your Managed Account User changes. Emergency calls are not supported by the Skype Software in the majority of countries around the world. If the countries in which Your Managed Account Users are located are not supported for limited emergency calling access then the provisions of paragraphs 2.1 and 14.1.3 (A) continue to apply and You should ensure that Your Managed Account Users do not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using the Skype Software.</p> <p><b>2.3.6</b> You acknowledge and agree that it is Your responsibility to inform, and You shall inform, Your Managed Account Users about the service limitations and the obligations referred to in paragraph 2.3.5 above regarding the Call Settings page of their Managed Account.</p> <h2><a name="3"></a><b>3. Quality, Technical Improvement and Maintenance</b></h2> <p><b>3.1 Quality: </b>Skype will use reasonable endeavors to provide the Skype Products with minimum disruptions.

Skype Manager and Managed Accounts</b></h2> <p><b>5.1 Purpose of Skype Manager.</b> A Skype Manager enables You to manage Your business communications. You may create Managed Accounts and SIP Profiles on Your Skype Manager, and purchase and allocate Skype Products to Your Managed Accounts and SIP Profiles for use by You and/or Your Managed Account Users. You may also view reports of those communications.</p> <p><b>5.2 Permitted Use of Managed Accounts.</b></p> <p><b>5.2.1</b> Managed Accounts may only be used in association with Skype Manager.</p> <p><b>5.2.2</b> You shall be responsible for the administration and management of all Managed Accounts that are members of Your Skype Manager. The creation of a Managed Account, the purchase of and allocation to a Managed Account of any Skype Products by You, and the use of any Skype Products by Your Administrators and Your Managed Account Users, shall be governed by this Agreement and any other applicable Additional Terms.</p> <p><b>5.2.3</b> You may set up and use a Managed Account for the following purposes:</p> <p><b>(i)</b> the individual use of a Managed Account by one Managed Account User only, for the communications purposes of such Managed Account User (&ldquo;Individual Use&rdquo;);</p> <p><b>(ii)</b> the use of a Managed Account by You via Your PBX or any other certified Skype Connect equipment, using Business Products for Your own communications purposes (&ldquo;Shared Use&rdquo;).</p> <p><b>5.2.4</b> You are not permitted to use a Subscription in connection with a Managed Account for Shared Use.</p> <p><b>5.3 Responsibility for Managed Account Users.</b> You shall be responsible for all usage of the Skype Products and Skype Software in connection with the Skype Manager and Managed Accounts including without limitation, any acts and omissions of any of Your Administrators and Managed Account Users to whom a Managed Account has been allocated. You shall ensure that all Your Administrators and Managed Account Users comply with this Agreement and any other applicable Additional Terms.</p> <p><b>5.4 Reallocation and Deletion of Managed Accounts. </b>If a Managed Account has been allocated to a specific Managed Account User for Individual Use and that Managed Account User leaves the Company, such Managed Account shall remain in the Skype Manager and may be allocated to another Managed Account User. You may delete such Managed Account from the Skype Manager rather than reallocate it to another Managed Account User. If You choose to delete such Managed Account then You acknowledge that the traffic data (including call history and text message history) in respect of a Managed Account is only visible whilst that Managed Account exists and such traffic data will no longer be accessible to You once that Managed Account has been deleted, and You are therefore responsible for printing out the traffic data records if You deem this necessary, before deleting the relevant Managed Account. Once a Managed Account is deleted, neither the Managed Account, nor the data previously associated with it, can be retrieved. Any Skype Numbers and Skype Credit that You have allocated to that Managed Account may be taken back to the Skype Manager and reallocated before the Managed Account is deleted. You may take the Skype Numbers back by manually removing them from the Managed Account. If You have purchased a Subscription and/or Voice messages for use with that Managed Account, such Subscription and/or Voice messages may not be taken back to the Skype Manager but will no longer be available once the Managed Account has been deleted.</p> <p><b>5.5 Password and email.</b></p> <p><b>5.5.1 Allocation.</b> You shall allocate a Password to each Managed Account that You create, or You may invite a Managed Account User to set up their own Password.

You shall ensure that neither You, Your Administrators or Managed Account Users shall share a Managed Account that is being used for Individual Use, or share Passwords.</p> <p><b>5.5.3. Security.</b> You shall (and shall ensure that Your Administrators and Managed Account Users shall) take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the User ID, Password and email address of Managed Accounts at all times. If You suspect that any Password has been shared in breach of this Agreement or has become known to anyone other than an Administrator or a Managed Account User to whom the Password has been allocated, then You shall ensure that such Password is immediately changed in order to protect Your Managed Accounts. It is Your responsibility to ensure that Your Managed Account Users and Administrators do not respond to any unsolicited requests for credit card details, Passwords or other data. Neither Skype nor its officers, employees or Affiliates may be held liable whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other form of liability for any claim, damage, or loss arising from or relating to any failure by You, Your Administrators and/or Managed Account Users to comply with this paragraph 5.5.3.</p> <p><b>5.6 Administrator(s).</b> You and Your Administrators may appoint additional Administrators to Your Skype Manager, and each Administrator shall be required to accept and agree to this Agreement and any other applicable Additional Terms. You shall procure that all Administrators read, agree to and comply with this Agreement and any other applicable Additional Terms, and You shall be responsible for any breach of the Terms by such Administrator(s). If You are an Administrator creating or managing a Skype Manager but not entering into this Agreement on behalf of a legally incorporated entity or You are not authorized to represent or act on behalf of such entity, then You shall be in breach of this Agreement and shall be personally liable for such breach and any other breach of this Agreement, and for any acts and omissions of any Managed Account Users or Administrators on Your Skype Manager.</p> <p><b>5.7 CLI</b></p> <p><b>5.7.1 Managed Accounts.</b> You can allocate a Skype Number to a Managed Account and use it as the CLI for that Managed Account.

You acknowledge and agree that You shall process (and shall ensure that Your Administrators shall process) such personally identifiable information and traffic data in accordance with all applicable data protection laws. You represent and warrant to keep all such personal and traffic data confidential and use and protect it strictly in compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p> <p><b>5.11 No Unsolicited Communications.</b> Under no circumstances shall You send (or allow Your Administrators and/or Managed Account Users to send) unsolicited commercial communications. You shall not (and You shall ensure that Your Administrators and/or Managed Account Users shall not) send or procure the sending of any communications, including email messages on behalf of, or purporting to originate on behalf of, Skype.
