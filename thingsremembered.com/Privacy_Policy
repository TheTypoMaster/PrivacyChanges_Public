Mailing Lists
From time to time, we make our mailing list (including names and addresses only) and general shopping activities available to carefully selected companies whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. We do not share email addresses for this purpose. If you do not wish to receive mailings from these carefully selected companies, simply call Customer Service at 866.902.4438.

Personal Information
We may also share your personal information, and any transactions you conduct on our site or offline with us with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver you advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain other websites. Data shared with our third-party partner is made anonymous.  If you wish to not have your information shared for these purposes, please contact us at 866.902.4438.

Security of Your Information
Rest assured that we utilize the latest encryption technology to ensure the safety of your personal information at Things Remembered. Your ordering information (name, address, credit card, etc.) is encrypted during the ordering process & transmission, using our secure server to provide the highest level of security possible. In addition, once received, your credit card data is stored on a server that cannot be accessed via the Internet.
We further protect your information using the following methods:

Password protection: When you create an account with us, your password creates another level of security for your personal information. Your password is your secret code into your account. Make your password a combination of at least 6 (no more than 10) characters/numbers that are not easily guessed (don't make your password your last name, for example). 
Site protection: Our entire site is protected behind an advanced firewall (think of it as a cyber fortress), which prevents unauthorized persons from accessing your information.
