              <p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the LastPass.com and other LastPass websites and all content, services and products available at or through the website (taken together, the Website). The Website is owned and operated by LastPass. The Website is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by LastPass (collectively, the &#8216;Agreement&#8217;).</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the web site. By accessing or using any part of the web site, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the website or use any services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by LastPass, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.</p>
<h2>Your Account.</h2>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. You must not use your account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and LastPass may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause LastPass liability. You must immediately notify LastPass of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. LastPass will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>
<p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, LastPass has the right (though not the obligation) to, in LastPass&#8217; sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in LastPass&#8217; reasonable opinion, violates any LastPass policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in LastPass&#8217; sole discretion.

In the case of such termination, LastPass will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to LastPass.</p>

LastPass shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<h2>General Representation and Warranty.</h2>
<p>You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Website will be in strict accordance with the LastPass Privacy Statement, with this Agreement and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Website will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>
<h2>Indemnification.</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless LastPass, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees, arising out of your use of the Website, including but not limited to out of your violation this Agreement.</p>
<h2>Use of LastPass by Kids</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">LastPass can be used by kids, however LastPass is not currently developed for children specifically and any use by children should be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. It is also the parents&#8217; or guardian&#8217;s responsibility to understand our Terms and our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p>If you are an educational organization or an educator like a school, district or teacher in the United States and want your students who to create LastPass accounts, including any use of a LastPass Enterprise account for the schools or a group of students at the school, you agree that you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Students’ parents/guardians must be notified of the use of LastPass, of the personally identifiable information that LastPass will collect, and of the LastPass Terms and Privacy Policy and you must obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use the Service. Copies of any communication should be kept for LastPass&#8217; review if needed. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm. If you are located outside of the United States, we will rely upon you to obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or guardian of any student covered by similar laws and, as a condition to your and your students’ use of the Service, you agree that you will be responsible for complying with such laws.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between LastPass and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of LastPass, or by the posting by LastPass of a revised version.

<p>The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys&#8217; fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties&#8217; original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; LastPass may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
