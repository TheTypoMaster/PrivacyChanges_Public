                <p style="margin-top:0px;">eBay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations. The actual contract for sale is directly between the sellers and buyers. eBay is not a traditional auctioneer. &nbsp;</p>
                <p style="">While we may provide pricing, shipping, listing, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">When a buyer or seller issue arises we may consider the user's performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.</p>
                <a name="5"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Fees</h3>

We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions.</p>
                <p style="">You must have a payment method on file when selling on eBay and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, and, for accounts over 180 days past due, instructing PayPal to deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account balance. In addition, you will be subject to <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/payment-due-date.html#requirements" target="_blank">late fees</a>. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.</p>

                <ul style="margin-top: 6px;"><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">You are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing and item offered.</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). eBay can't guarantee exact listing durations.</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Content that violates any of eBay's policies may be deleted at eBay's discretion.</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for.

                        <ul style="margin-top: 6px;"><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">item's&nbsp;location, listing format,&nbsp;price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query; </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">seller's history, including listing practices, Detailed Seller Ratings, eBay policy compliance, Feedback, and defect rate; and</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">number of listings matching the buyer's query.</p>
                                <p style="">Accordingly, to drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer. &nbsp;</p></div></li></ul></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on certain Services.</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">eBay's <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-multi.html" target="_blank">Duplicate Listing Policy</a> may also affect whether your listing appears in search results.</p></div></li></ul>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Many of our Services are accessible to international sellers and buyers.

Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.</p>
                <p style="">You may list your items directly on one or more of eBay's international sites. Additionally, you may direct us to display your listing on eBay sites other than the original eBay listing site, including where you choose to list an item with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping or the Global Shipping Program): the appearance of your listings on these sites is not guaranteed. When you sell your items internationally, you agree to be subject to that other site's policies and the <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/international-selling.html" target="_blank">eBay International Selling Policy</a>. You may restrict international buyers from purchasing your items if you explicitly exclude international shipping from your listings and apply an exclusion list to your listings.</p>
                <p style="">If you are a seller you authorize us to use automated tools to translate your eBay content, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. If you are a buyer, you may have access to tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed and you should check your translated listing for accuracy.</p>

                <p style="">We may offer catalogs including stock images, descriptions and product specifications that are provided by third-parties (including users).

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">To protect eBay from risk of liability for your actions as a seller, eBay has at times recommended, and may continue to recommend, that PayPal restrict access to funds in a seller's PayPal account based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, returns, riskiness of the listing category, transaction value, or the filing of an eBay Money Back Guarantee case. This may result in PayPal determining to restrict funds in your PayPal account.</p>

                        <p style="">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.&nbsp;An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>
                        <p style=""><br>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp;The use of the word "arbitrator" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration: rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.<br>
                            <br>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). You may download a form Notice <a href="http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/Notice_of_Dispute.pdf " target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;The Notice to eBay should be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020.&nbsp;eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date.&nbsp;All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.</p>
                        <p style=""><br>If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party.&nbsp;You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o National Registered Agents, Inc., 2778 W. Shady Bend Lane, Lehi, UT 84043.&nbsp;In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>
                        <p style=""><br>The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.&nbsp;In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. </p>
                        <p style=""><br>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

                        <p style="">Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.  In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
