we may provide your PII to certain companies with which we have a relationship to allow them to send you targeted offers and pre-populate offers that they believe you may be interested in receiving.</p>
<p>We use other third party service providers such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services or an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf and we will provide your PII to such service providers so that they can assist us in providing our service to you. These third parties are contractually prohibited from using your PII for their own promotional purposes.</p>

&quot;served&quot;) directly to users by third party advertisers. Some of these third party advertisers automatically receive certain of your PII through your interaction with an advertisement.

&quot;web beacons&quot; to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Their use of your PII will be governed by the terms of their privacy policies and their privacy policies may explain the way in which you can

<h2 id='eu-notice'>Notice to European Users</h2>
<p>The information you enter on this Site or otherwise provide to IMVU may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America and other jurisdictions which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by IMVU on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id='update-pii'>Correction/Updating PII</h2>
<p>IMVU provides you with the ability to review, correct and delete the PII that you have provided to us in your account.
