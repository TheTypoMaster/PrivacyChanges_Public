Privacy Policy


 Effective as of April 25, 2014

This policy describes KAYAK’s practices regarding personally identifiable information and data (“personal information”). This policy applies to our websites, mobile applications, email and text messages, and social media accounts (the “Platforms”). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.


The categories of Personal Information we collect
When you visit the Platforms, we may collect information from you. Some of it may be personal information. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location.
If you book a travel product via the Platforms, we may need additional information from you. This information can include your name (and traveler’s name if different), passport number, email address, telephone number, credit card information, billing address, itinerary and frequent flyer details. You can also choose to store personal information in your user account for future bookings.
If you choose to register, we will collect your email address, password and home airport, and other preference information you provide us. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store that information related to the account.
If you use our “My Trips” service, we will collect your travel information to create and maintain your travel itineraries. This can include the personal information that may be included in the confirmation emails you forward to us.
If you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.


How we collect your Personal Information
We collect your personal information directly from you. For example, when you provide us your personal information when you register or book travel.
We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect information about you over time and across different Web sites when you visit this Platform. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. To learn more about these tools and how to control them, click here.
We collect your personal information from third parties. This can include when you log in using a third party platform, such as Facebook.


Why we use your Personal Information
To provide you and improve our Platforms and services, to better understand the users of our Platforms and services, to protect our property and to prevent damage to them.
To process your bookings.
To display more relevant advertising and recommendations, or suppress advertising and content that you might find irrelevant.
To contact you, including as follows:

» To send booking confirmations;
» To send alerts and notifications you have subscribed to, including to your mobile device;
» To solicit reviews;
» When you send booking confirmations to our My Trips service;
» To get in touch if you contact KAYAK customer service;
» To send you information servicing and administrative emails;
» To send you marketing emails from a KAYAK address regarding our services or those of our partners, if you have opted-in to receive emails from us or have transacted with us, and as permitted by law.



Your Choices
You can manage your communication preferences in your account. Every marketing email has an opt-out URL and you can unsubscribe from such communication at any time. You cannot unsubscribe from servicing emails and administrative messages that are considered part of your account membership, unless you cancel your membership.


How we share your Personal Information
We may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for our legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers who perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information.
If you book through the Platforms, we may share your personal information with the payment service providers and the travel vendors you have booked with. This can include online travel agencies, hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and travel insurance providers. These third parties will process your personal information as data controllers in accordance with their own privacy policies.
We may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners.
If KAYAK itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, owners would have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.
If you use our My Trips Service, you can send or grant access to your itinerary to anyone you choose. Your itinerary may contain enough details (for example, booking reference codes) to allow the recipient to cancel or modify your booking, perform a check-in, etc. You should only share your itinerary with people you trust. Please also read the detailed My Trips FAQ. If you choose to display your itinerary on publicly-viewable web pages (Facebook, for instance), that information may be collected and used by others.
If you provide us a review of your trip, you authorize us to publish it on all our Platforms under the screen name you provided. You also authorize us to aggregate it with other reviews.
We may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.
We may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.


How we store and protect your Personal Information
Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S and in Switzerland, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.
KAYAK has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third party suppliers, who require such access to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy.


Cookies and tracking tools
KAYAK uses cookies and tracking tools. To learn more, including how we respond to “Do not track” signals click here.


Other Websites
If you click through to third party websites or other platforms, KAYAK’s privacy policy does not apply.


Children
KAYAK does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.


Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. By using our services and Platforms after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them.


Accessing and rectifying your Personal Information
You can manage your account settings in the “My Account” page on KAYAK. You can delete your account http://www.kayak.com/zap at any time.
You are entitled at any time to obtain information about all your personal information that we store, in accordance with applicable law and without any fee. However, in exceptional cases we ask you to pay reasonable fee before we provide the information if permitted by applicable law. We may request proof of your identity before providing this information. We may not be able to allow you to access certain personal information in some cases. For example if your personal information is connected with personal information of other persons, or for legal reasons. In such cases we will provide you with an explanation why you cannot obtain this information. You can also withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information at any time by contacting us at the address below. You can demand deletion or rectification of your personal information, however, statutory provisions, especially those affecting KAYAK’s accounting, processing of claims, and mandatory data retention, may prohibit deletion or anonymization.
To exercise your rights, or if you have questions about our privacy practices or need assistance with exercising or understanding your privacy choices, please contact our Privacy Officer at privacy-officer@kayak.com or you may write to:
KAYAK Attention: Privacy Officer 7 Market Street Stamford, CT 06902, USA.

 

Cookies and other tracking tools



KAYAK uses tracking tools such as cookies
We (or our suppliers) use several common tracking tools. We use these tools to collect usage and demographic information about you over time and across different Web sites when you use our Platforms. We also have third parties (e.g. advertisers) that collect personal information this way. Tools we use may include browser cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small file.
We and our advertising partners may also use web beacons (single pixel GIF images). These web beacons are placed in the code of a Web page or an email newsletter.
By using the Platforms, you give us your free, unambiguous and informed consent to the use of any of the cookies and tracking tools mentioned in this policy.


KAYAK uses tracking tools for following purposes

(i) To track new visitors to the Platforms.
(ii) To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor. This includes saving and remembering any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting the Platforms, such as language.
(iii) To store your username and password if you are registered with us.
(iv) To work with online advertising companies to display targeted advertising on our Platforms and third party platforms that you visit. This targeting may be based on information you submit on our Platforms or third party platforms. This targeting may also be based on your activities or behaviors on our Platforms or those of third parties. We may also obtain information about your browsing history from our business partners. To learn more about targeted advertising and how you can accept or refuse (opt-out of) this type of advertisements, we recommend that you visit www.aboutads.info/choices or www.youronlinechoices.eu.
(v) To track when you book on partner websites.
(vi) To help improve our website offering and for capacity planning purposes. We or our third party service providers may set analytics cookies. These allow us to gather aggregated or segmented information about the types of visitors that access our Platforms and the pages and advertisements that they view. We do not use this information to personally identify you.



How you can control tracking tools and opt-out of online behavioral advertising
Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information.
To opt out of having your online behavior tracked for advertising purposes click here.
We may also use Google Analytics to collect demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. You can find out more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out by going here. Choices you make are browser and device specific. Some aspects of our site use cookies to function. You may not be able to use these features if you set your device to block cookies. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.


How KAYAK responds to “Do Not Track” signals
Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
If you have any questions on our use of tracking tools, please use the feedback form.
