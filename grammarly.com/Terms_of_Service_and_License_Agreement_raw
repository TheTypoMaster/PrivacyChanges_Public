                <h2>Enterprise Subscriber Responsibility for Authorized Users</h2>

                <p>Enterprise Subscribers shall ensure that the total number of&nbsp;Authorized Users does not exceed
                    the
                    maximum number of&nbsp;seats authorized by&nbsp;and purchased from Grammarly (each of&nbsp;which
                    seats represents
                    a&nbsp;unique (named) Authorized User). Authorized Users may not transfer (including by&nbsp;way of&nbsp;sublicense,
                    lease, assignment or&nbsp;other transfer, including by&nbsp;operation of&nbsp;law) their seat, user
                    name or&nbsp;right
                    to&nbsp;use the Site, Services or&nbsp;Software to&nbsp;any third party. You, the Enterprise
                    Subscriber, are solely
                    responsible for the way your Authorized Users use the Site, Services and Software, and for ensuring
                    that all of&nbsp;your Authorized Users comply with all of&nbsp;the terms and conditions of&nbsp;this
                    Agreement.
                    Any violation of&nbsp;the terms and/or conditions of&nbsp;this Agreement by&nbsp;an&nbsp;Authorized
                    User shall be&nbsp;deemed
                    to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;violation thereof by&nbsp;you.</p>

                <h2>Fees, Payment and Trial Memberships</h2>

                <p>If&nbsp;you have registered to&nbsp;use certain Services and/or Software on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trial basis,
                    then you may use
                    such Services and Software only for noncommercial evaluation purposes during the applicable trial
                    period. In&nbsp;all other cases, unless you are an&nbsp;Enterprise Subscriber or&nbsp;Authorized
                    User thereof, your
                    access to&nbsp;or&nbsp;use of&nbsp;the Services and/or Software shall be&nbsp;contingent upon your
                    payment of&nbsp;all
                    applicable fees as&nbsp;described on&nbsp;the Site from time to&nbsp;time (&ldquo;Fees&rdquo;).
                    Enterprise Subscribers shall
                    pay the fees set forth in&nbsp;the invoice(s) rendered by&nbsp;Grammarly in&nbsp;accordance with the
                    payment terms
                    set forth therein.</p>

                <p>Upon registering for Services, unless you are an&nbsp;Enterprise Subscriber or&nbsp;Authorized User
                    thereof,
                    you will be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;designate a&nbsp;valid credit card or&nbsp;PayPal&trade; account.
                    You hereby authorize
                    Grammarly to&nbsp;charge to&nbsp;your designated account all Fees relating to&nbsp;the Services you
                    select, and
                    you agree to&nbsp;pay all such Fees in&nbsp;accordance with the applicable card member agreement or&nbsp;PayPal&trade;
                    terms and conditions.</p>

                <p>Grammarly reserves the right to&nbsp;revise its Fees, including by&nbsp;increasing or&nbsp;adding new
                    Fees, at&nbsp;any

                    in&nbsp;its commercially
                    reasonable discretion. You will be&nbsp;deemed to&nbsp;have received any such notice that is&nbsp;posted
                    on&nbsp;the

                    period constitutes
                    your acceptance of&nbsp;the new or&nbsp;revised Fees. If&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not agree to&nbsp;the
                    revised Fees, you may cancel

                    <p>At&nbsp;Grammarly&rsquo;s or&nbsp;your election, all disputes, claims or&nbsp;controversies
                        arising out
                        of&nbsp;or&nbsp;relating to&nbsp;this Agreement or&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;the Site, Software or&nbsp;Services
                        that are not resolved by&nbsp;mutual agreement shall be&nbsp;resolved by&nbsp;binding
                        arbitration
                        to&nbsp;be&nbsp;conducted before JAMS, or&nbsp;its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by&nbsp;the
                        parties,
                        arbitration will be&nbsp;held in&nbsp;San Francisco, California before a&nbsp;single arbitrator
                        mutually
                        agreed upon by&nbsp;the parties, or&nbsp;if&nbsp;the parties cannot mutually agree, a&nbsp;single
                        arbitrator
                        appointed by&nbsp;JAMS, and will be&nbsp;conducted in&nbsp;accordance with the rules and
                        regulations
                        promulgated by&nbsp;JAMS. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of&nbsp;the
                        date
                        on&nbsp;which a&nbsp;written demand for arbitration is&nbsp;filed by&nbsp;either party. The
                        arbitrator&rsquo;s
                        decision and award will be&nbsp;made and delivered within sixty (60) days of&nbsp;the conclusion
                        of&nbsp;the arbitration and within six (6) months of&nbsp;the selection of&nbsp;the arbitrator.
                        The
                        arbitrator will not have the power to&nbsp;award damages in&nbsp;excess of&nbsp;the limitation
                        on&nbsp;actual
                        compensatory, direct damages set forth in&nbsp;this Agreement and may not multiply actual
                        damages
                        or&nbsp;award punitive damages or&nbsp;any other damages that are specifically excluded under
                        this Agreement,
                        and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to&nbsp;such damages. The arbitrator may, in&nbsp;his
                        or&nbsp;her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and
                        expenses
                        of&nbsp;the prevailing part) against any party to&nbsp;a&nbsp;proceeding. Any party refusing to&nbsp;comply
                        with an&nbsp;order of&nbsp;the arbitrators will be&nbsp;liable for costs and expenses, including
                        attorneys&rsquo;
                        fees, incurred by&nbsp;the other party in&nbsp;enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the
                        foregoing, in&nbsp;the
                        case of&nbsp;temporary or&nbsp;preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in&nbsp;court
                        without
                        prior arbitration for the purpose of&nbsp;avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The
                        provisions of&nbsp;this
                        arbitration section will be&nbsp;enforceable in&nbsp;any court of&nbsp;competent
                        jurisdiction.</p>

                    <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of&nbsp;the introductory section above, if&nbsp;Grammarly changes
                        this
                        &ldquo;Arbitration&rdquo; section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or&nbsp;accepted
                        any subsequent changes to&nbsp;this Agreement), you may reject any such change by&nbsp;sending
                        Grammarly
                        written notice within thirty (30) days of&nbsp;the date such change became effective. By&nbsp;rejecting
                        any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Grammarly in&nbsp;accordance
                        with the provisions of&nbsp;this section as&nbsp;of&nbsp;the date you first accepted this
                        Agreement
                        (or&nbsp;accepted any subsequent changes to&nbsp;this Agreement).</p>

                    <h2>General Provisions</h2>

                    <p>This Agreement shall be&nbsp;governed&nbsp;by, and construed in&nbsp;accordance with, the laws of&nbsp;the
                        State of&nbsp;California, without regard to&nbsp;any choice of&nbsp;law, conflicts of&nbsp;law
                        or&nbsp;other
                        principles that would result in&nbsp;the applicable of&nbsp;the laws or&nbsp;regulations of&nbsp;any
                        other jurisdiction. Subject to&nbsp;the section titled &ldquo;Arbitration&rdquo;, any legal
                        action
                        or&nbsp;proceeding relating to&nbsp;this Agreement shall be&nbsp;instituted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state
                        or&nbsp;federal court in&nbsp;San Francisco County, California. You and Grammarly agree to&nbsp;submit
                        to&nbsp;the jurisdiction&nbsp;of, and agree that venue is&nbsp;proper&nbsp;in, these courts in&nbsp;any
                        such legal action or&nbsp;proceeding.</p>

                    <p>This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein are personal to&nbsp;you, and you may not
                        assign
                        or&nbsp;otherwise transfer this Agreement or&nbsp;any of&nbsp;your rights or&nbsp;obligations
                        hereunder,
                        by&nbsp;operation of&nbsp;law or&nbsp;otherwise, without the prior written consent of&nbsp;Grammarly.
                        Grammarly may freely assign this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>If&nbsp;any one or&nbsp;more of&nbsp;the provisions of&nbsp;this Agreement are for any reason
                        held
                        to&nbsp;be&nbsp;invalid, illegal or&nbsp;unenforceable by&nbsp;a&nbsp;court of&nbsp;competent
                        jurisdiction,
                        the remaining provisions of&nbsp;this Agreement shall be&nbsp;unimpaired and shall remain in&nbsp;full
                        force and effect, and the invalid, illegal or&nbsp;unenforceable provision(s) shall be&nbsp;replaced
                        by&nbsp;a&nbsp;valid, legal and enforceable provision or&nbsp;provisions that comes closest to&nbsp;the
                        intent of&nbsp;the parties underlying the invalid, illegal or&nbsp;unenforceable
                        provision(s).</p>

                    <p>The failure of&nbsp;either party to&nbsp;exercise in&nbsp;any respect any right provided for
                        herein
                        shall not be&nbsp;deemed a&nbsp;waiver of&nbsp;any further rights hereunder. A&nbsp;waiver by&nbsp;either
                        party of&nbsp;any term or&nbsp;condition of&nbsp;this Agreement or&nbsp;any breach thereof, in&nbsp;any
                        one instance, will not waive such term or&nbsp;condition or&nbsp;any subsequent breach
                        thereof.</p>

                    <p>If&nbsp;Grammarly is&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;perform any obligation under this Agreement because of&nbsp;any
                        matter beyond its reasonable control, such as&nbsp;lightning, flood, exceptionally severe
                        weather, fire,
                        explosion, war, civil disorder, industrial disputes (whether or&nbsp;not involving employees of&nbsp;Grammarly),
                        acts of&nbsp;local or&nbsp;central government or&nbsp;other competent authorities, problems with
                        telecommunications providers, hostile network attacks or&nbsp;other events beyond Grammarly&rsquo;s
                        reasonable control (each, a&nbsp;&ldquo;Force Majeure Event&rdquo;), Grammarly will have no&nbsp;liability
                        to&nbsp;you for such failure to&nbsp;perform; provided, however, that Grammarly shall resume
                        performance
                        promptly upon removal of&nbsp;the circumstances constituting the Force Majeure Event. If&nbsp;any
                        Force
                        Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) days, either Grammarly or&nbsp;you may
                        terminate this
                        Agreement by&nbsp;delivery of&nbsp;written notice to&nbsp;the other party. You will remain
                        responsible
                        for all Fees incurred through the last day the Services were available.</p>

                    <p>If&nbsp;you and Grammarly have executed a&nbsp;separate Subscription Agreement applicable to&nbsp;your
                        access to&nbsp;and use of&nbsp;the Site, Services and/or Software, then the terms and conditions
                        of&nbsp;such Subscription Agreement shall prevail to&nbsp;the extent of&nbsp;any conflict with
                        the
                        terms and conditions of&nbsp;this Agreement. In&nbsp;all other cases, this Agreement constitutes
                        the
                        entire agreement between Grammarly and you with respect to&nbsp;its subject matter, and
                        supersedes
                        all prior communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or&nbsp;written, between
                        Grammarly
                        and you. No&nbsp;waiver or&nbsp;modification of&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the provisions of&nbsp;this
                        Agreement
                        shall be&nbsp;binding unless in&nbsp;writing and signed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;duly authorized
                        representative
                        of&nbsp;each party.</p>
