			If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner
			in which we share certain categories of personal information with third parties and the HSNi companies for their direct marketing purposes. California
			law gives you the right to send us a request at a designated address to receive the following information:
		


		1. the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year;

			activities over time and across different websites when you use our online Services or browse other websites. For more information about "Do Not
			Track," please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.

Linked information:


Cookies
		:
	

		A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer or device for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or
		persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our online Services. A
		persistent cookie remains on your hard drive or device for an extended period of time.
	

		We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our online Services to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing
		analysis and research on the effectiveness of our Services, content, and advertising.
	

		You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of
		the features and services of our online Services may not function properly.
	

		We may allow third parties, including HSNi companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our Services. These companies
		may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our Services do not
		provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer or device,
		saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They
		also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third
		party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party
		advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad
		targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).
	

Web Beacons
		:
	

		Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to
		track the online movements of users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive or device, web beacons are
		embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in e-mail) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
	

		Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages, and to understand usage patterns. We also
		may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our online Services from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
	

Mobile Services:


		We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded any of our mobile application(s). This information is generally
		used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used may include, but are not limited to,
		your geographic location, how you use our application(s), and information about the type of device you use. This information is sent to us as aggregate
		information, and is not traceable back to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual. To opt out of sharing this information, such as
		location, please review the terms and conditions before you download the application, or you may review the settings on your mobile device or you may
		choose at any time to uninstall our application(s) from your mobile device.
