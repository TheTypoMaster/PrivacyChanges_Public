    are always able to accept or reject the Suggested Contact. We may propose you as Suggested Contact to other users.
    In doing so, we may use the name and profile picture you have provided to us and show this to other users. We will
    not share your direct contact details such as your phone number or your email address with any other users.

    log-ins, email addresses, passwords, or phone numbers with third parties, unless it is necessary for use of the
    Service.</p>

<ul>
    <li>we are obliged to do so pursuant to legal provisions; and/or</li>

    <li>it is necessary for the protection of our own rights or property; and/or</li>
    <li>it is necessary to protect the personal safety of our users or members of the public</li>
</ul>

<p>eBuddy will take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect against
    loss, misuse or any form of unlawful processing. Information on eBuddy servers is stored in a secured manner and

    company are transferred to a third party or that eBuddy merges with a third party. Also, in the unlikely event of
    a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, parts of the company may be transferred to a third party. In those
    cases, the information we have collected may also be transferred. In such an event, we make every effort to ensure
    that the entity that gains control over the information will commit to at least the same level of protection as
    described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="transfer">7. Transfer to countries outside the EU</h2>

<p>It may be required for technical and operational reasons that the information we collect, including your
    (personal) details are transferred to servers in the United States or other countries outside the European Union
    where the regulations in the field of privacy protection might not provide the same protection as in the European
    Union. By using the Service you are giving your consent to this, in so far as your consent is necessary.
    Notwithstanding the above, eBuddy will use reasonable endeavors to ensure that the necessary measures and relevant
    controls are in place in order to protect the confidentiality and security of the information we collect,

    law to store the information we collect, even after you have terminated your use of the eBuddy Services.</p>

<p>For technical reasons, it may be impossible for us to determine whether you have stopped using the eBuddy
    Services. For the mobile applications, it may also be impossible for eBuddy to determine whether you have deleted
    the application. In such cases, we reserve the right to remove your account and the information you have provided
    us if you have not used the Service for an extended period of time.</p>
