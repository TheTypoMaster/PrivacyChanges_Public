Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared with third parties and used for direct marketing purposes and the name and address of the third parties that received such personal information. If you are a California resident and want a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: Bloomingdale's Customer Service, P.O. Box 8067, Mason, OH 45040.

International Customer Privacy
To fill international orders, bloomingdales.com partners with Borderfree, Inc. (“Borderfree”). Borderfree will carefully process your personal information with at least the same level of privacy protection set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S. Swiss Safe Harbor established by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Borderfree also agrees not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international shipments.

When you indicate you are shipping internationally, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by Borderfree. On the checkout page you will be required to submit personal information to Borderfree to complete your order. Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive future marketing communications from bloomingdales.com.

Borderfree will notify bloomingdales.com of the approval of your order, and bloomingdales.com will then ship approved orders to Borderfree. Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree’s terms and conditions. You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.

Once you agree that Borderfree may share your personal information with bloomingdales.com, that data is protected by this notice of privacy practices and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.

If a customer feels that the privacy protections afforded by the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework may have been violated, please contact Borderfree through its privacy policy. Borderfree will attempt to directly resolve the complaint. Any complaints that are still unresolved after these direct efforts with Borderfree, will be settled by arbitration administered by TRUSTe in accordance with its applicable commercial rules. All customers shipping internationally who wish to:

Inquire about or update their personal information
Make a complaint about the collection or use of their personal information
Comment on or ask questions regarding this International Customer Privacy section
