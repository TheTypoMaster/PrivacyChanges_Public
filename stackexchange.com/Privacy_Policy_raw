                if it would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive. As
                such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below, because we don’t control
                it; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such information means that you

                It also increases your chances of receiving unwanted communications, like spam.

                or enter bankruptcy, user information could be transferred or acquired. You
                should be aware that such events can occur, and that if it does, the buyer may continue
                to use your personal and non-personal information, but only as set forth in this

                This section covers any ways in which personal information we collect from employees
                or applicants might be treated differently than user information. You can probably
                stop here if you not an employee or interested in applying for a job with Stack
                Exchange. But maybe you should be interested: Who wouldn’t want to work with an
                amazingly talented team dedicated to making the Internet a better place to get expert
                answers to questions, especially at a company with free lunches, top-notch benefits,
                and a CEO who has literally written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1590598385/?tag=stackoverfl08-20">
                    the book</a> on how to make great workplaces for building amazing software.
                The more I think about it, the more I think maybe you should click here after all:

                And if you do, be sure to review the following non-comprehensive list of ways that
                we may use information provided to us by employees or applicants:

                The lawyers say I have to remind you again that you really need to read the long
                version on the right. Which hurts my feelings a little, but is still probably good
                advice.
