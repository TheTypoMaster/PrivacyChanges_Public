  <br>
  Q1: How long will my opt-out preferences last?<br>
     A: Your GM telephone and email opt-out preferences will be honored in accordance with applicable law and will remain in effect unless you take action to opt back in to receiving materials from us (for example by Request a Quote or completing a Business Reply Card).&nbsp;Your GM direct mail opt-out preferences will expire three (3) years from the date of your submission. You can change or update your opt-out preferences by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gmcontactpreferences.com/">clicking here</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Q2: Does my vehicle have a black box to record data?<br>
     A: GM vehicles, like other modern motor vehicles, have a number of sophisticated computer systems that monitor and control several aspects of the vehicle's performance. GM vehicles use on-board vehicle computers to monitor emission control components to optimize fuel economy, to monitor conditions for air bag deployment and, if so equipped, to provide anti-lock braking and to help the driver control the vehicle in difficult driving situations. Some information may be stored during regular operations to facilitate repair of detected malfunctions; other information is stored only in a crash event by computer systems, such as those commonly called event data recorders (EDR).&nbsp;To learn more about vehicle recording and privacy, refer to the Vehicle Data Recording and Privacy section of your vehicle’s owner manual.</p>
<p>Q3: Does my vehicle have an RFID feature that transmits my personal information?<br>
     A: No, many GM vehicles contain sensing and transmitting devices using the same type of radio frequency transmission technology used in RFIDs that can contain personal information. These devices are used to perform functions such as checking tire pressure. The devices do not store or transmit personal information.&nbsp;To learn more about vehicle recording and privacy, refer to the Vehicle Data Recording and Privacy section of your vehicle’s owner manual.</p>
