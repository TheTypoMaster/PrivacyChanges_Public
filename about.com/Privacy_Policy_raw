            <h6 class="subheader inline-title">Providing the Services You Request</h6>
            <p>We use the information we gather about you to enable your use of the Services, fulfill your requests
                for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to
                participate in and renew paid services, polls, contests, and message boards. We reserve the right to
                disclose your opt-out information to third parties so they can suppress your name from future
                solicitations, in accordance with applicable laws. In addition, if you request that we send your
                information to a third party service, such as for earning rewards points or other benefits, we may do so
                and use of that information by the third party is subject to their privacy policy.</p>

            <p>We use the information that we collect to allow advertising to be targeted to the users for whom such
                advertising is most pertinent. We may also use this information to customize certain features of the
                Services to provide you with an enhanced experience based on information such as the type of device you
                are using to access the Services, your activities on the services, or your location or geo-location. We
                may also use this information to provide you with services you have requested.</p>

                which may help them enhance their own products, data or analytics.</p>

            <h6 class="subheader inline-title">Our Parent Company</h6>
            <p>About, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC and an operating company of Ask.com. We share
                information we collect with our affiliates (entities that are under common ownership or control) to
                better understand our users (their demographics, what they do on our Websites, what Website features
                they like, how they use them, etc.), to serve ads on other IAC websites, and to improve the content and
                answers delivered on the Services and on affiliate services, such as Ask.com's services.</p>

    <h6 class="subheader">Communication with Guides, Experts and other Contributors to the Services</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>The Services feature content provided by people who are independent contractors and not employees of
            About, including content provided by contributors including those we call "Experts" or "Guides." If you
            contact an Expert or Guide (or other contributor) directly by email through the Services (including via an
            about.com or aboutguide.com email domain) or otherwise then that communication is independent of the
            Services, and thus not subject to this Privacy Policy. Although About contractually requires its Expert and
            Guide contributors to maintain information from About users in confidence, About cannot and does not
            guarantee that they will do so, and is not responsible for what our contributors may say, or how they may
            use information you have freely provided to them. Likewise, your communications with a contributor are not
            private or confidential, nor are such communications protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any

    <p id="adchoices" class="text-large">Information Collected by Third-Parties and Your Ad &amp; Cookie Choices</p>
    <p>Third parties may collect information about you through the Services, including through use of the
        technologies for serving relevant ads and other reasons as described above. We may not have access to, nor
        control over, these third parties' data collection practices and we do not assume any liability related to their
        collection or use. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other
        tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Websites. The information they collect
        may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal
        information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.
        They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted
        content on the Websites or on any other websites on the Internet.</p>
    <p>For instance, like many other websites and applications, in addition to our own systems, we may use other
        third-party ad servers, analytics platforms and data management platforms to serve and display Advertisements,
        or to collect information about you and your use of the Services for other analytics purposes. They may use
        cookies, pixel trackers, web beacons or other internet or mobile
        technology to collect non-personal and/or anonymous information about your use of the Services (e.g., click
        stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) and precise
        geolocation and user device identification (if you have provided your consent for such collection) during and
        about your visits to the Websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
        likely to be of greater interest to you. In certain cases, you have options and choices about the collection and
        use of information by third parties on our Websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For more information about these third-party Ad Networks and opting out of tracking through the NAI,
            visit: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition to the above, we have implemented on our Services certain "Google Analytics" features that support
        Display Advertising, including re-targeting. Visitors to our Websites may opt out of Google Analytics, customize
        the Google Display Network ads by using the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/">Google Ad
            Preferences Manager</a> and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its <a
            href="https://support.google.com/ads/?hl=en">Customer Ads Help Center</a>. If you do not wish to participate
        in Google Analytics, you may also download the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google

    <p class="text-large">Other Privacy Considerations</p>
    <p>We may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a transfer
        or all or part of our business or assets (e.g., a sale, merger, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization) or
        are taking steps in anticipation of such a transaction (e.g., participating in due diligence).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h6 class="subheader inline-title">Do Not Track Browser Disclosure</h6>
            <p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way
                for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage
                visits collected over time and across websites or online services.</p>
            <p>
                We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our
                Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI "Consumer Opt-out" link and the
                DAA opt-out link <a href="#anchor_cookiepolicy">above</a>.
                However, <strong>we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals</strong>, as the
                Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to
                comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

        <li>
            <h6 class="subheader inline-title">Information from Children Under 13</h6>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we
                determine that a user is under 13, we will delete all personally identifiable information collected from
                that user.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6 class="subheader inline-title">Information from Users Outside of the United States</h6>
            <p>If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and
                stored in our servers in the U.S. By using our Services, you consent to our collection and use of your
                data as described in this privacy policy, and acknowledge that data protection laws in the U.S. may be
                different or less restrictive than in some other countries.</p>

            <h6 class="subheader inline-title">Your California Privacy Rights</h6>
            <p>Under the California "Shine The Light" law, California residents may opt-out of the disclosure of
                personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes (as those concepts are defined in
                that law) However, we do not currently engage in the type of sharing covered by that law.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6 class="subheader inline-title">Compliance With Legal Process</h6>
            <p>We may disclose personal information (1) if we believe such sharing is appropriate to comply with the
                law or with legal process; (2) to protect and defend our rights, services or property; (3) to protect
                against misuse or unauthorized use of the Services; or (4) to protect the safety or property of our
                users or any member of the public (among other things, this means that if we believe you have provided
                false information or attempted to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part
                of any investigation into your actions).</p>
