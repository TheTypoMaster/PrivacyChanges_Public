Terms of Use

PLEASE READ THE TERMS OF USE BELOW. THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS WHEN
            USING OUR SERVICES.



Acceptance of these Terms of Use.
            The About.com service and its affiliate sites and products, including About.com, About.net,
                AllExperts.com, CalorieCount.com, and Netplaces.com (collectively the "Sites") are owned and operated by
                About, Inc. and its affiliates ("About", the "Company", "we", or "us" ). Access to and use of the Sites
                are subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use (including disclaimers regarding
                professional, medical and nutritional information).
            
"Sites" or "About" shall include any information or services made available by About,
                        regardless of the medium, and shall include, without limitation any affiliated websites, mobile
                        applications, videos, products and applications we make available. We reserve the right at any
                        time, and from time to time, to modify, suspend or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the
                        Sites, or any part of the Sites, with or without notice. You agree that we shall not be liable
                        to you for any such action.

The Sites are not intended for users under 13 years of age. If you are under
                            13, do not use the Sites and do not provide us with any personal information. The Sites are
                        designed for those people who reside in the United States or any of its territories and
                        possessions. We make no claims that the Sites or any of their content is accessible or
                        appropriate outside of the United States. Access to the Sites may not be legal by certain
                        persons or in certain countries. If you access the Sites from outside the United States, you do
                        so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.
                    



Modification of these Terms of Use.
We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions of these Terms of Use at any time. You
                should check this page regularly. The changes will appear on the Sites and will be effective when we
                post the changes. Your continued use of the Sites means you agree to and accept the changes. If a Site
                contains additional terms and conditions then those terms and conditions shall apply to your use of such
                Site, in addition to these terms and conditions, provided, that, in the event of a conflict with these
                terms and conditions, the conflicting terms and conditions of such Site shall apply only to your use of
                that Site and only to the extent of the conflict.


Our Privacy Policy.

                Our Privacy Policy contains further information about how data is collected, used and made available on
                or by our Sites. We recommend that you read it, here.
            


Intellectual property.


Limited license. The materials used and displayed on the
                    Sites, including but not limited to text, software, photographs, graphics, illustrations and
                    artwork, video, music and sound, and names, logos, trademarks and service marks, are the property of
                    About or its affiliates or licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark and other laws. Any
                    such content may be used solely for your personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to modify,
                    reproduce, retransmit, distribute, disseminate, sell, publish, broadcast or circulate any such
                    material without the written permission of About or the appropriate affiliate. About grants you a
                    personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Sites for non-commercial
                    purposes subject to these Terms of Use. You may link to our homepage, provided you do so in a way
                    that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not
                    establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on our
                    part without our express written consent. Any use of the Sites not expressly permitted by these
                    Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate copyright, trademark and other laws.
                

Trademarks. The terms About, About.com, Calorie Count,
                    ConsumerSearch and other Company trademarks and services marks, and associated logos and all related
                    names, logos, product and service names, designs and slogans are trademarks of About or its
                    affiliates or licensors. You must not use such marks without the prior written permission of About.
                    All other names, logos, product and service names, designs and slogans on the Sites are the
                    trademarks of their respective owners.
                

Copyright. If you believe content on the Sites violates your
                    copyright, please see our DMCA Policy, below.
                



No reliance on information posted on the Sites, including User
                Contributions or content by independent contributors such as Experts or Guides.


We do not have an obligation to, and you should not expect
                        us to review content on our Sites, including User Contributions or contributions by our
                        independent contributors known as "Experts" or "Guides." Although About and its affiliates may
                    from time to time monitor or review discussions, chats, postings, transmissions, and other user and
                    member generated pages on the Sites, we are under no obligation to do so. You acknowledge that we do
                    not control the information available on Site forums, chat rooms and other user and member generated
                    pages and that any opinions, advice, services, offers or other information or content disseminated
                    through the Sites are those of their respective authors, including users, Experts, Guides and other
                    writers and contributors, who are solely liable for their content. We reserve the right, in our sole
                    discretion, to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted through the Sites.
                    


About our Experts. About seeks out content providers in
                    particular subject matters as independent contributors who publish the content they write (click here to find out about becoming an "Expert"). However, About
                    does not represent or guarantee that any 'Expert' or 'Guide' has achieved any particular level of
                    expertise or knowledge or has any specific qualifications or credentials, without limitation, as to
                    the subject matter to which their contributions relate. We may refer to each of these contributors
                    as an 'Expert' or 'Guide', but you must understand we rely on the information they provide us and we
                    do not independently verify or attempt to confirm any information they provide, nor their
                    qualifications or credentials. About also does not monitor or independently research or verify any
                    content they contribute. Contributors, even if characterized as 'Expert' or a 'Guide', are not
                    employees of About or its affiliates and About cannot and does not represent or warrant the
                    accuracy, completeness or truthfulness of the qualifications or credentials of any contributor, nor
                    of any other users of the Service or Sites. Each Expert or Guide has a biography posted on the Site
                    where the Expert or Guide describes their own experience.
                


                        Don't rely on site content, including User Contributions and content from independent
                        contributors known as Experts or Guides. Content, articles, materials, information and postings
                        by contributors are provided purely for general information purposes only and can never take
                        into account your unique, personal circumstances and needs. Never rely upon such general
                        information in making decisions about specific situations, or use it as a substitute for
                        in-person evaluation or professional advice (including, without limitation, medical, legal, tax,
                        financial or veterinary issues), even if from individuals About characterizes as an 'Expert' or
                        a 'Guide.' You acknowledge and agree that any reliance or actions you take in violation of your
                        agreement with us, shall be at your sole and exclusive risk and About shall have no
                        responsibility or liability to you whatsoever. You also acknowledge and agree that
                        communications on or through the Service, whether with content providers or other
                        users, are at your own risk and are not covered by any privilege or confidentiality obligation
                        that might apply if you were to obtain your own professional advice (e.g., attorney-client;
                        doctor-patient).

To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the

The Site may contain message boards, chat rooms, personal web pages or profiles, forums,
                        bulletin boards and other interactive features (collectively, "Interactive Services") that allow
                        users to post, submit, publish, display or transmit to other users or other persons
                        (hereinafter, "post") content or materials (collectively, "User Contributions") on or through

                        such as on a forum, chat room or on any other user or member generated pages, that information
                        can be viewed in search engines, collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited
                        contact from other parties. We advise that you not post any personal or other
                            sensitive information on our Sites.

All User Contributions must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Terms of Use.
Any User Contribution you post to the site will be considered non-confidential and
                        non-proprietary. By providing any User Contribution on the Site, you grant us and our affiliates
                        and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors and assigns
                        the right to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute and otherwise disclose to
                        third parties any such material for any purpose.
You represent and warrant that:

You own or control all rights in and to the User Contributions and have the right to
                            grant the license granted above to us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of
                            their and our respective licensees, successors and assigns.
All of your User Contributions do and will comply with these Terms of Use.

You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Contributions you submit
                        or contribute, and you, not the Company, have full responsibility for such content, including
                        its legality, reliability, accuracy and appropriateness.
We are not responsible, or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any User
                        Contributions posted by you or any other user of the Site.
The Sites may provide certain social media features that enable you to:

                            displayed on your own or certain third-party websites.

                        content they are displayed with and otherwise in accordance with any additional terms and
                        conditions we provide with respect to such features.
The website from which you are linking, or on which you make certain content accessible, must
                        comply in all respects with the Content Standards set out in these Terms of Use.
You agree to cooperate with us in causing any unauthorized framing or linking immediately to
                        cease. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice.
We may disable all or any social media features and any links at any time without notice in
                        our discretion.


Monitoring and enforcement; termination
We have the right to:

Remove or refuse to post any User Contributions for any or no reason in our sole
                            discretion.
Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or
                            appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Contribution
                            violates the Terms of Use, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual
                            property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of
                            users of the Site or the public or could create liability for the Company.
Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims
                            that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property
                            rights or their right to privacy.
Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law
                            enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Site.
Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Site for any or no reason,
                            including without limitation, any violation of these Terms of Use. 
                            Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law
                            enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity
                            or other information related to anyone posting any materials on or through the Site. YOU
                            WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM
                            ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING OR AS A
                            RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS
                            BY EITHER THE COMPANY/SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. 
                            However, we cannot and do not undertake to review all material before it is posted on the
                            Site, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted.
                            Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions,
                            communications or content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or
                            responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in
                            this section.

        personally identifiable information. For example, we collect information when you:

Sign up to receive email newsletters. When we send newsletters
            to subscribers we may allow advertisers or partners to include messages in those newsletters, or we may send
            dedicated newsletters on behalf of those advertisers or partners. To unsubscribe from a particular

            and the public at large, including comments, forums, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other
            items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name
            or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by us for online and offline promotional or
            commercial uses in any and all media. Information you submit is not private or
                confidential, nor is it protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any other privilege and
                (regardless of restrictions we impose in our Terms of Use or other policies) it might be read,
                collected and used by others, including through third party search engines which may index the
                information you post. You therefore should be aware that any personally identifiable information you
            submit there might be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas, and could be used to send you
            unsolicited messages, mine your data, communicate with or market to you in other ways. We are not
            responsible for safeguarding the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums

Information We Collect Using Technology

            logs, and other Internet technology for purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of the Services, emails
            we send you, and any advertising campaigns, as well as to target meaningful content and ads (including
            through emails). Sometimes, we may facilitate the use by third party platforms of these anonymous cookies,
            or similar technology, to help those third parties better target ads to you based on other websites you may

IP Addresses. We log Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or the
            location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use
            this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to our Services (websites and mobile applications),
            and may also use it to infer your location, as also discussed in the below section titled "Geolocation
            Data."
Geolocation Data. For certain mobile applications we offer, we
            may (or may enable a third party, including an advertiser to) request your geolocation information in order
            to provide you with ads, offers, search or other functionality. If you agree to such collection, we (or the
            third party) may maintain information regarding your precise geolocation including over time and may use it
            to help enable that functionality, or other functionality we describe to you in connection with the mobile
            application or website. In addition, we may (or may enable a third party, such as an
            advertiser to) capture geo-location information (such as based on IP address data) when you access our
            Services, and may use that geo-location information to targets ads or offers to you.
Analytics. We may use third parties to provide us information,
            reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of users of the Services. These reports contain
            aggregated or anonymous data only, and do not identify individual users to About.com.

            about your use of the Services. This information includes a reading history of the pages you view and a
            record of the sites from which you clicked on a link to visit ours.

        variety of technologies to learn more about how people interact with our Services. This section provides more
        information about some of those technologies and how they work.

Cookies. Cookies are small files that websites and other online services use to store
            information about users on the users' own computers. Cookies can be used to store sign-in credentials so
            that you don't have to enter them each time you return to a website, or to store other information to make
            web viewing more customized or efficient upon future visits. Cookies also may store a unique identifier tied
            to your computer so that web services and advertising networks can recognize you across visits to different
            websites. You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse
            all or certain cookies completely.  We (or our partners) may use or support cookies for
            purposes including the following:
            
To collect information about your browsing activities in order to deliver customized or
                    relevant services, advertising or content to you (including regarding our own products and content),
                    when you browse our Website or other websites or open the emails we send you;
To relate the information collected by cookies to information we obtain from you directly or
                    from commercially available sources;
To work with third parties that serve advertisements (through our Services or across the
                    Internet) or provide other services to us, such as providing users the ability to comment on
                    content, allowing users to share content, or tracking website usage statistics. We do not control
                    these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the third
                    parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks and services
                    that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info, and to

Other Local Storage. We (or our partners) may use other kinds
            of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local
            storage, in connection with the Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in
            that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and
            preferences. However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser
            cookies. Your browser may allow you to disable its HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in
            its HTML5 local storage. For information about deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects or
            adjusting related preferences, please click here.
Web Beacons. We (or our partners) may use technologies called
            web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be
            embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information
            from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine,
            among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer,
            and the URL of the web page from which the web beacon was viewed. These web beacons may be used for a
            variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide
            content and ads that are more relevant to you.

How We May Use and Share the Information We Collect


Providing the Services You Request
We use the information we gather about you to enable your use of the Services, fulfill your requests
                for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to
                participate in and renew paid services, polls, contests, and message boards. We reserve the right to
                disclose your opt-out information to third parties so they can suppress your name from future
                solicitations, in accordance with applicable laws. In addition, if you request that we send your
                information to a third party service, such as for earning rewards points or other benefits, we may do so
                and use of that information by the third party is subject to their privacy policy.


Statistical Analysis
We use the information, including analytics and statistical information, to analyze the use of the
                Services so that we may improve them. We also use this information to generally inform advertisers about
                the nature of our user base.


Customizing Your Experience
We use the information that we collect to allow advertising to be targeted to the users for whom such
                advertising is most pertinent. We may also use this information to customize certain features of the
                Services to provide you with an enhanced experience based on information such as the type of device you
                are using to access the Services, your activities on the services, or your location or geo-location. We
                may also use this information to provide you with services you have requested.


Service Providers
We may contract with other companies that provide services to us, including credit-card and billing
                processors, survey administrators, technical or customer support, shipping, e-mail distribution, email
                service providers, data enhancement and information or analytics providers, list processing and
                promotions management. Sometimes, we may provide to these service providers aggregate or anonymized
                information about how users interact with our Services (or other information provided to us by users),
                which may help them enhance their own products, data or analytics.


Our Parent Company
About, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC and an operating company of Ask.com. We share
                information we collect with our affiliates (entities that are under common ownership or control) to
                better understand our users (their demographics, what they do on our Websites, what Website features
                they like, how they use them, etc.), to serve ads on other IAC websites, and to improve the content and
                answers delivered on the Services and on affiliate services, such as Ask.com's services.


Communication with Guides, Experts and other Contributors to the Services

The Services feature content provided by people who are independent contractors and not employees of
            About, including content provided by contributors including those we call "Experts" or "Guides." If you
            contact an Expert or Guide (or other contributor) directly by email through the Services (including via an
            about.com or aboutguide.com email domain) or otherwise then that communication is independent of the
            Services, and thus not subject to this Privacy Policy. Although About contractually requires its Expert and
            Guide contributors to maintain information from About users in confidence, About cannot and does not
            guarantee that they will do so, and is not responsible for what our contributors may say, or how they may
            use information you have freely provided to them. Likewise, your communications with a contributor are not
            private or confidential, nor are such communications protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any
            other privilege. For more information see our Ethics Policy and Terms of Use.

        content on the Websites or on any other websites on the Internet.
For instance, like many other websites and applications, in addition to our own systems, we may use other
        third-party ad servers, analytics platforms and data management platforms to serve and display Advertisements,
        or to collect information about you and your use of the Services for other analytics purposes. They may use
        cookies, pixel trackers, web beacons or other internet or mobile
        technology to collect non-personal and/or anonymous information about your use of the Services (e.g., click
        stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) and precise
        geolocation and user device identification (if you have provided your consent for such collection) during and
        about your visits to the Websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
        likely to be of greater interest to you. In certain cases, you have options and choices about the collection and
        use of information by third parties on our Websites:

For more information about these third-party Ad Networks and opting out of tracking through the NAI,
            visit: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

For more information about disabling and controlling third-party cookies in your browser, visit: http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1



        In addition to the above, we have implemented on our Services certain "Google Analytics" features that support
        Display Advertising, including re-targeting. Visitors to our Websites may opt out of Google Analytics, customize
        the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad
            Preferences Manager and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its Customer Ads Help Center. If you do not wish to participate
        in Google Analytics, you may also download the Google
            Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
    
Other Privacy Considerations
We may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a transfer
        or all or part of our business or assets (e.g., a sale, merger, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization) or
        are taking steps in anticipation of such a transaction (e.g., participating in due diligence).


Do Not Track Browser Disclosure
Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way
                for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage
                visits collected over time and across websites or online services.

                We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our
                Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI "Consumer Opt-out" link and the
                DAA opt-out link above.
                However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the
                Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to
                comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
            


Information from Children Under 13
We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we
                determine that a user is under 13, we will delete all personally identifiable information collected from
                that user.


Information from Users Outside of the United States
If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and
                stored in our servers in the U.S. By using our Services, you consent to our collection and use of your
                data as described in this privacy policy, and acknowledge that data protection laws in the U.S. may be
                different or less restrictive than in some other countries.


Your California Privacy Rights
Under the California "Shine The Light" law, California residents may opt-out of the disclosure of
                personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes (as those concepts are defined in
                that law) However, we do not currently engage in the type of sharing covered by that law.


Compliance With Legal Process
We may disclose personal information (1) if we believe such sharing is appropriate to comply with the
                law or with legal process; (2) to protect and defend our rights, services or property; (3) to protect
                against misuse or unauthorized use of the Services; or (4) to protect the safety or property of our
                users or any member of the public (among other things, this means that if we believe you have provided
                false information or attempted to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part
                of any investigation into your actions).
