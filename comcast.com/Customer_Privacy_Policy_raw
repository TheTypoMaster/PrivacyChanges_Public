<p>As a subscriber to cable service or other services provided by Comcast, you are entitled under Section 631 of the federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, (the &ldquo;Cable Act&rdquo;) to know the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>the limitations imposed by the Cable Act upon cable operators in the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information about subscribers; </li>
    <li>the nature of personally identifiable information we collect; </li>
    <li>the nature of the use of personally identifiable information; </li>
    <li>under what conditions and circumstances we may disclose personally identifiable information and to whom; </li>
    <li>the period during which we maintain personally identifiable information; </li>
    <li>the times and places at which you may have access to your personally identifiable information;</li>
    <li>the times and places at which you may have access to your personally identifiable information; and</li>
    <li>your rights under the Cable Act concerning personally identifiable information and its collection and disclosure. </li>
</ul>
<p>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person; it does not include de-identified, anonymous, or aggregate data that does not identify a particular person or persons.  This notice is also provided to you in accordance with applicable California law, which only applies to our customers located in California who are served by a cable television corporation.</p>
<p>In addition, Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, (the &ldquo;Communications Act&rdquo;) and the FCC’s rules (47 C.F.R. § 64.2001 – 64.2011) provide additional privacy protections for certain information related to our phone services:</p>

<ul>
    <li>information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of your use of the phone services; and </li>
    <li>information contained on your telephone bill concerning the type of phone services and features you receive. </li>
</ul>
<p>That phone information is known as customer proprietary network information or CPNI for short.  This notice, which includes our CPNI Policy, describes what CPNI information we obtain, how we protect it, and how it may be used.  If you are a customer of our phone services, you have the right, and Comcast has a duty, under the Communications Act and applicable state law, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI.  We explain below under &ldquo;HOW DO I GIVE OR WITHHOLD MY APPROVAL FOR COMCAST TO USE CPNI TO MARKET ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ME?&rdquo; how you can approve our use of CPNI or withdraw your approval.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Special Note:</strong> Our CPNI Policy applies to the voice communications-related services provided by the applicable Comcast operating company that delivers voice services to our customers.<br />
<br />
In this notice, the terms &ldquo;Comcast,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; refer to the operating company subsidiary or subsidiaries of Comcast Corporation that (i) owns and/or operates the cable television system in your area pursuant to a cable television franchise with the local franchising authority, or (ii) is the operating company that delivers voice services in your area.  The term &ldquo;you&rdquo; refers to you as a subscriber to one or more of our cable service and other services.</p>

<p>The Cable Act applies to personally identifiable information that you have furnished to Comcast, or that Comcast has collected using the cable system, in connection with the provision of cable service or other services. The Communications Act applies to CPNI related to our regulated phone services, and certain orders of the Federal Communications Commission apply the CPNI rules to our interconnected voice over Internet protocol communications services.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note:</strong> This notice only applies to our cable video service, our high-speed Internet service, our phone and communications services, and our home security service.  It applies to you as a subscriber to one or more of these services as provided for by applicable law and except as otherwise noted.

<div><a name="For what purposes may Comcast collect personally identifiable information and CPNI?" style="color: #000000;"><strong>For what purposes may Comcast collect personally identifiable information and CPNI?</strong></a><br />

<p>The Cable Act authorizes Comcast as a cable operator to use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning any subscriber for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers; and </li>
    <li>to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Cable Act prohibits us from using the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning any subscriber for any purposes other than those listed above without the subscriber’s prior written or electronic consent.</p>
<p>The Communications Act authorizes us to use, disclose, or permit access to individually identifiable CPNI in our provision of:</p>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>the telecommunications services from which this information is derived; or </li>
    <li>services necessary to, or used in, the provision of these services, including the publishing of directories. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Communications Act prohibits us from using CPNI for any purposes other than those listed above except as permitted or required by law or with your approval.</p><a href="#backtotop1">Back to Top</a></div>

<div><a name="What kind of personally identifiable information does Comcast collect?" style="color: #000000;"><strong>What kind of personally identifiable information does Comcast collect?</strong></a><br />

<p>Comcast collects information from you at several different points when you request, turn on, and use our services under an account we create for you.  Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not.  We collect certain personally identifiable information that our subscribers furnish to us in connection with the provision of cable service or other services.  In order to provide reliable, high quality service to you, we keep regular business records containing information about you that may constitute personally identifiable information.  These account records include some, but typically not all, of the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your name; </li>
    <li>service address; </li>
    <li>billing address; </li>
    <li>e-mail address; </li>
    <li>telephone number; </li>
    <li>driver&rsquo;s license number; </li>
    <li>social security number; </li>
    <li>bank account number; and</li>
    <li>credit card number.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to phone services, examples of CPNI include information typically available from telephone-related details on your monthly bill:</p>
<ul>
    <li>location of service; </li>
    <li>technical configuration of service; </li>
    <li>type of service; </li>
    <li>quantity of service; </li>
    <li>amount of use of service;&nbsp;and </li>
    <li>calling patterns. </li>
</ul>
<p>CPNI does not include your name, address, and telephone number, because the Communications Act classifies that information as &ldquo;subscriber list information&rdquo; which is not subject to the protections applicable to CPNI.&nbsp; However, that information is also subject to certain protections as described below under &ldquo;To whom may Comcast disclose personally identifiable information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We also collect and maintain certain other information about your account.&nbsp; For example, this information may include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>your account number; </li>
    <li>billing, payment, and deposit history; </li>
    <li>additional service information </li>
    <li>customer correspondence and communications records;  </li>
    <li>maintenance and complaint information;  </li>
    <li>the device identifiers and network addresses of equipment used with your account; </li>
    <li>records indicating the number of television sets, set-top boxes, modems, telephones, home security and automation devices, or other devices connected to our cable system; and </li>
    <li>additional information about the service options you have chosen. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our services permit you to establish secondary accounts, and if you do so we collect similar information in order to establish and service the secondary accounts.  During the initial provisioning of our services, and during any subsequent changes or updates to our services, Comcast may collect technical information about your televisions, any set-top boxes, computer hardware and software, cable modems, telephones, other cable or other service-related devices, home security and automation devices, and customization settings and preferences.  Additionally, if you rent your residence, we may have a record of whether landlord permission was required prior to installing our cable services as well as your landlord's name and address.</p><a href="#backtotop1">Back to Top</a></div>

<p>When you use cable video services, our cable system automatically generates information about your use of the services and their features, and we collect much of this information as part of providing services to you.  For example, we receive information about the use of set top boxes, remote controls, electronic program guides, video players, applications, and other devices and software connected to our cable system.  This information includes which channels, programs, and advertisements are viewed and for how long, for example.  It may also include information about navigation through program guides and applications, and use of devices like remote controls and tablets.  Except as described below, we collect this <em>activity data</em> without names and addresses or other personally identifiable information and we consider it <em>de-identified</em> data. </p>
<p>Our system may collect activity data with personally identifiable information for particular requests or transactions like when you order a pay-per-view program or purchase a product.  This information typically consists of account and billing-related information such as the programs or other products, services, or features ordered so that you may be properly billed for them.  Follow your program guide commands or any special instructions on your screen when you make these transactional requests.  These commands and instructions will explain your choices so that you can complete or cancel your requests as you wish.</p><a href="#backtotop1">Back to Top</a></div>

<p>Comcast’s cable system, set-top boxes, and other equipment generate activity data that we collect and store.  We use this information for a number of purposes including to determine which programs are most popular, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, and whether people are watching commercials. As described below under &ldquo;How does Comcast use personally identifiable information and CPNI?,&rdquo; we may also provide information like subscriber lists or certain de-identified, anonymous, and/or aggregate information (such as activity data) to third parties working on our behalf -- such as audience measurement or market research firms.  We, or these firms, working as our service providers, may combine this information with aggregated or non-aggregated demographic information (such as census records) and other audience attributes, such as purchasing data, demonstrated interests (for example, in sports programs or movies), loyalty programs, organizational affiliations, advertiser customer lists, and the like to provide us with audience analysis data.  We require third parties working on our behalf to treat all information we provide as confidential and to use it only for Comcast’s business purposes.  We may also work with academic or research interest groups to analyze de-identified, anonymous, and/or aggregate information we provide to them for specific purposes or projects. </p>
<p>We use this information and analysis to improve our cable video service and other services and make programming and advertising more relevant to our subscribers.  We may also use this information to distribute and deliver relevant programming and advertising to you without disclosing personally identifiable information about you to programmers or advertisers.  In addition to this privacy notice, we may provide additional notices to you regarding specific advertising or other initiatives.  These notices will describe the initiatives in greater detail and may, as appropriate, contain information you can use to choose to participate, or not participate, in these initiatives. </p><a href="#backtotop1">Back to Top</a></div>

<p>We associate activity data with particular devices such as set top boxes, portable devices, and other supported devices so that we know where to deliver the services and how to troubleshoot them.  In general, Comcast uses de-identified and aggregate activity information to understand better how our customers use our products and services so that we can improve them, including by delivering more relevant content and advertising.  We may try to determine how well our products and services deliver value to our customers, for example, by determining which programs are most popular, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, and whether and how often people are watching commercials.  As discussed below, we may also combine activity data with other non-personally identifying demographic and similar information from our business records.</p>
<p>When we collect activity data, we may also use it to determine how many people view commercials (impressions) and to provide de-identified or aggregate reports to third-party advertisers.  When we do this reporting on advertising impressions we do not provide any personally identifiable information about our subscribers to third-party advertisers.</p>
<p>We may also use activity data to help us learn how popular certain programs are and how our customers as a whole generally prefer to view certain kinds of programming using cable video service (such as whether they like to watch certain programs live, or they prefer to view them when we offer them on demand, on mobile devices, or online).  As described below, this may require us to compare or combine activity data on our cable system with online activity data.  We may also use activity data to determine whether promoting content and services in certain ways helps attract a larger audience and more customers.  While we may provide aggregate reports on these observations to programmers or others, we do not provide any personally identifiable information about our subscribers, or the activities of individual subscribers, to those programmers and others.</p>
<p>We may also use, or combine information about, your use of our cable services with other information we obtain from our business records (such as your Comcast account number or device identifiers), or from third parties, to deliver better and more relevant products, services and advertising.  However, we do not store or use your activity data in association with your name or address, except as necessary to render or bill for our services.  We may try to determine, using aggregated data, which groups of our customers use which of our products and services and how they use them.  To do this we, or third parties working on our behalf, may combine demographic and other generally available information, or advertiser information, including purchasing data and membership in loyalty programs, with our subscriber lists.  From this information, we or our third party providers prepare de-identified and aggregated reports about how groups of customers with common characteristics – such as age and gender, or a demonstrated interest in a particular third party product  – use our services and respond to the programming and advertising that we distribute.  We may use this information to improve and communicate with you about our own products and services, and also to help us deliver relevant information and advertising on behalf of other companies and advertisers to certain subscriber groups – known as <em>ad groups</em>– who may be most interested in this information and advertising.  When we do this, we do not share your personally identifiable information with these advertisers, unless you provide your express consent.</p>
<p>We may also combine personally identifiable information, which we collect as described in this notice as part of our regular business records, with personally identifiable information obtained from third parties for the purpose of creating an enhanced database or business records. We may use this database and these business records in marketing and other activities related to our cable service and other services. We also maintain records of research concerning subscriber satisfaction and viewing habits, which are obtained from subscriber interviews, questionnaires, and surveys or panels.</p>

<ul>
    <li>necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to, the cable service or other services provided to the subscriber; </li>
    <li>required by law or legal process (described below under &ldquo;When is Comcast required by law to disclose personally identifiable information and CPNI by law?&rdquo;); or </li>
    <li>of the names and addresses of subscribers for &ldquo;mailing list&rdquo; or other purposes (subject to each subscriber&rsquo;s right to prohibit or limit this disclosure and the CPNI Policy described below under &ldquo;How do I place myself on Comcast&rsquo;s &lsquo;do not call&rsquo; and &lsquo;do not mail&rsquo; lists?&rdquo;). </li>

<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information as provided for in the Cable Act when it is necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to, the cable service or other services we provide to you.  These kinds of disclosures typically involve billing and collections, administration, surveys, marketing, service delivery and customization, maintenance and operations, incident verification and response, service notifications, and fraud prevention, for example.  We may also collect, use, and disclose information about you in de-identified, anonymous, or aggregate formats, such as ratings surveys and service usage and other statistical reports, which do not personally identify you, your particular viewing habits, or the nature of any transaction you have made over the cable system.  The frequency of any disclosure of personally identifiable information varies in accordance with our business needs and activities.</p>
<p>The Cable Act authorizes Comcast as a cable operator to disclose limited personally identifiable information to others, such as charities, marketing organizations, or other businesses, for cable or non-cable &ldquo;mailing list&rdquo; or other purposes.&nbsp; From time to time we may disclose your name and address for these purposes.&nbsp; However, you have the right to prohibit or limit this kind of disclosure by contacting us by telephone at 1-800-XFINITY or by sending us a written request as described below under &ldquo;How do I contact Comcast?&rdquo;&nbsp; Any &ldquo;mailing list&rdquo; and related disclosures that we may make are limited by the Cable Act to disclosures of subscriber names and addresses where the disclosures do not reveal, directly or indirectly, (i) the extent of any viewing or other use by the subscriber of a cable service or other service provided by us; or (ii) the nature of any transaction made by the subscriber over our cable system.</p>
<p>We may sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates or to others who work for us.&nbsp; We may also disclose personally identifiable information about you to outside auditors, professional advisors, service providers and vendors, potential business merger, acquisition, or sale partners, and regulators.&nbsp; We make these disclosures as provided for in the Cable Act.&nbsp; Typically, we make these disclosures when the disclosure is necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to, the cable service or other services we provide to you.&nbsp; We may be required by law or legal process to disclose certain personally identifiable information about you to lawyers and parties in connection with litigation and to law enforcement personnel.</p>
<p>If we (or our parent company) enter into a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, subscribers&rsquo; personally identifiable information will, in most instances, be one of the items transferred as part of the transaction.&nbsp; If this notice will be changed as a result of a transaction like that, you should refer below under &ldquo;Will Comcast notify me if it changes this notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may also use or disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent to protect our customers, employees, or property, in emergency situations, to enforce our rights under our terms of service and policies, in court or elsewhere, and as otherwise permitted by law.</p><a href="#backtotop1">Back to Top</a></div>

<ul>
    <li>We may transmit your name and/or telephone number to be displayed on a Caller ID device unless you have elected to block such information.  Please note that Caller ID blocking may not prevent the display of your name and/or telephone number when you dial certain business or emergency numbers, 911, 900 numbers, or toll-free 800, 888, 877, 866 or 855 numbers. </li>
    <li>We may provide your name, address, and telephone number to public safety authorities and their vendors for inclusion in E911 databases and records, inclusion in “reverse 911” systems, or to troubleshoot 911/E911 record errors.  </li>
    <li>We may publish and distribute, or cause to be published and distributed, telephone directories in print, on the Internet, and on disks.  Those telephone directories may include subscriber names, addresses, and telephone numbers, without restriction to their use. </li>
    <li>We may also make subscriber names, addresses, and telephone numbers available, or cause such subscriber information to be made available, through directory assistance operators. </li>
    <li>We may provide subscribers’ names, addresses, and telephone numbers to unaffiliated directory publishers and directory assistance providers for their use in creating directories and offering directory assistance services. </li>
    <li>Once our subscribers&rsquo; names, addresses, and telephone numbers appear in telephone directories or directory assistance, they may be sorted, packaged, repackaged and made available again in different formats by anyone. </li>

<p>We make every reasonable effort to protect subscriber privacy as described in this notice.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information or individually identifiable CPNI about a subscriber.&nbsp; These disclosures may be made with or without the subscriber&rsquo;s consent, and with or without notice, in compliance with the terms of valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.</p>
<p>For subscribers to our cable video service, Comcast may be required as a cable operator to disclose personally identifiable information to a third-party or governmental entity in response to a court order.  If the court order is sought by a non-governmental entity, we are required under the Cable Act to notify the subscriber of the court order.  If the court order is sought by a governmental entity, the Cable Act requires that the cable subscriber be afforded the opportunity to appear and contest in a court proceeding relevant to the court order any claims made in support of the court order.  At the proceeding, the Cable Act requires the governmental entity to offer clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the case.</p>
<p>For subscribers to our high-speed Internet, phone, and home security services, Comcast may be required to disclose personally identifiable information and individually identifiable CPNI to a private third party in response to a court order, and, if so, we are required to notify the subscriber of the court order.  Comcast may also be required to disclose personally identifiable information and individually identifiable CPNI about subscribers to high-speed Internet, phone, and home security services to a government entity in response to a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, for example.  We are usually prohibited from notifying the subscriber of any disclosure of personally identifiable information to a government entity by the terms of the subpoena, court order, or search warrant.</p><a href="#backtotop1">Back to Top</a></div>

We will correct our records if you make a reasonable showing that any of the personally identifiable information we have collected about you is inaccurate.</p>

<p>If you have Internet access, you can view and change certain information yourself by going to <a href="http://www.xfinity.com/myaccount">www.comcast.com/myaccount</a> and signing in with your Comcast username and password to access the My Account feature.  If you are a home security customer, you can go to the subscriber portal at

<p>You may also examine the records containing your personally identifiable information at your local Comcast office upon reasonable prior notice to us and during our regular business hours.  If you wish to examine these records, please contact us by mail or telephone at 1-800-XFINITY, giving us a reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for review, and to arrange an appointment.  You will only be permitted to examine records that contain personally identifiable information about your account and no other account.</p>
<p>If you make an affirmative, written request for a copy of your CPNI, we will disclose the relevant information we have to you at your account address of record, or to any person authorized by you, if we reasonably believe the request is valid.  However, subscribers to our phone services should be aware that we generally do not provide them with records of any inbound or outbound calls or other records that we don’t furnish in the ordinary course of business (for example, as part of a bill) or which are available only from our archives, without valid legal process such as a court order.  In addition, we cannot correct any errors in customer names, addresses, or telephone numbers appearing in, or omitted from, our or our vendors’ directory lists until the next available publication of those directory lists.  Further, we may have no control over information appearing in the directory lists or directory assistance services of directory publishers or directory assistance providers that are not owned by our subsidiaries or us.</p>

<p>In addition to phone and voice services, various direct and indirect subsidiaries of Comcast Corporation offer many other communications-related services, such as high-speed Internet and home security services.  From time to time we may like to use the CPNI information we have on file to provide you with information about our communications-related products and services or special promotions.  Our use of CPNI may also enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to your specific needs. In addition, Comcast also offers various other services that are not related to the services to which you subscribe.  Under the CPNI rules, some of those services, such as Comcast cable video services, are considered to be non-communications related products and services. Therefore, you may be asked during a telephone call with one of our representatives for your oral consent to Comcast’s use of your CPNI for the purpose of providing you with an offer for communications related or non-communications related products and services.  If you provide your oral consent for Comcast to do so, Comcast may use your CPNI only for the duration of that telephone call in order to offer you additional services.</p>
<p>If you deny or restrict your approval for us to use your CPNI, you will suffer no effect, now or in the future, on how we provide any services to which you subscribe.
