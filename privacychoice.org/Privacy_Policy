Having trouble? Try these tips:
			PrivacyFix is a bit complicated under the hood, so things may not always work perfectly. Take these steps if you have a problem.
		


Restart your browser

					A fresh session makes sure that your browser is up to date. If your tabs don't automatically re-load, you can find them in Settings > History. Note that PrivacyFix does not work if you are using Private or Incognito browsing.
				


Disable add-ons

					Other add-ons (particularly privacy tools) can interfere with PrivacyFix. Go to Addons (Firefox) or Extensions (Chrome) to disable them temporarily and re-run PrivacyFix.
